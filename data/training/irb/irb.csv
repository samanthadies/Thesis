https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858207 ,Discovering Shifts to Suicidal Ideation from Mental Health Content in Social Media,Privacy Ethics and Disclosure,2,We use public data from Reddit. Personally identifiable information was removed and content was de-identified and paraphrased before being reported in the paper for exemplary purposes. This work has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB). Our work does not make any diagnostic claims related to mental illness or suicide.
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702613.2732733,Detecting and Characterizing Mental Health Related Self-Disclosure in Social Media,Data Collection,0,We used Reddit's official API to collect posts comments on posts and associated metadata from several mental health focused subreddits. We build on the data collection methodology we used in [4]. In order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized Reddit's native subreddit search feature (http://www.reddit.com/reddits). We searched for subreddits on “mental health”. Two researchers familiar with Reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search results returned so that we “seed” on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concerns. Thereafter we focused on a snowball approach to compile a second list of “related” or “similar” subreddits that are mentioned in the profile pages of the seed subreddits. Sample of subreddits (31 in all) we crawled are given in Table 1. Note all of these subreddits host public content. For the purposes of self-disclosure detection we also identified subreddits (sample listed in Table 2) as our control group (total of 12 subreddits) – meaning they are unrelated to mental health topics. For sanity check we randomly sampled a set of 200 posts from the control subreddits and two researchers familiar with Reddit manually checked their content for presence of any mental health content. We found that 97% of subreddit content in our sample were not about any mental health concern (Cohen’s Kappa for inter-rater agreement was .84). In all our dataset had 32509 posts from 23807 users in the mental health subreddits and 15383 posts from 13216 users in the control forums. For each of the unique users in the mental health forums we further collected all of their Reddit post/comment histories (last 1000 posts/comments per Reddit API limits) if their number of posts and comments in our dataset was five or more – this gave us 7248 users and 4.1M posts/comments
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702280,Recognizing Depression from Twitter Activity,Data Gathering,2,Administration of the website and processing of the obtained data were performed under the approval by the ethical committee in the organization to which authors belong. In this study we gathered information on depression levels of Twitter users and their activity histories. To do this we published a website to administer a questionnaire and disseminated information about the website over Twitter1. In contrast to De Choudhury et al. [14] who collected data from Englishspeaking users through crowdsourcing this study collected data from Japanese-speaking volunteers. This approach was used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research [14]. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of our website. The website collected the responses to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the Twitter users who participated (hereinafter the participants) and to collect the histories of participants activities on Twitter. The activity histories of participants were collected through the Twitter application programming interface (API)2 and the questionnaires to determine degree of depression were completed by participants through their web browsers. Before data collection visitors to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aims of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled. Those who consented to become participants after receiving the explanation logged into their individual Twitter accounts through the OAuth authorization process. Next participants were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression. A message called the “kokoro score” (“kokoro” is a Japanese word meaning “heart”) determined on the basis of answers to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweets was displayed to participants after completion of the questionnaire (Fig. 2). Experiment participants were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over Twitter by word-of-mouth in a type of snowball sampling. The CES-D questionnaire was used to evaluate the degree of depression [30]. In the CES-D test participants answered 20 questions on a Likert-type 4-point scale. Each answer was assigned a score of 0-3 points with the sum of the points from all answers used as the score to estimate likelihood of depression. Several standards exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression. In this research we regarded a score of 22 points or higher as indicating active depression and a score of 21 points or lower as indicating no active depression; these are the same values as used in [14] and give a cutoff score of 22. In addition answers to BDI [2] a depression scale used with characteristics similar to CESD were collected to ensure the reliability of data. For each participant scores were calculated on both scales with poor correlation regarded as indicating unreliable answers. The time taken to answer the questionnaires was also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded. After each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on Twitter was collected from Twitter by using the API. At most 3200 tweets were collected for each participant and the number of users following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded. Tweets published after the questionnaire was taken were discarded. The website was opened to the public on 4 December 2013 at which time the authors publicized it on their Twitter accounts. Between 4 December 2013 and 8 February 2014 219 people participated in the experiment. After eliminating participants who did not tweet and participants who answered the questionnaire in fewer than 30 seconds (as previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answers) 214 sets of answers remained. Only the first set of answers was used for participants who completed the questionnaire more than once. As a result data about 209 experiment participants (male: 121; female: 88) aged 16 to 55 (mean: 28.8 years; standard deviation: 8.2 years) were analyzed. The correlations between CES-D score and BDI score for these participants were high 0.87 and there were no participants with uncorrelated scores so the data for all 209 participants were used; excluded datasets are not discussed any further. Figure 3 shows the histogram of CES-D scores of 209 participants. Among the participants 81 (resp. 128) were estimated to have (resp. not have) active depression for an incidence of approximately 39%. This incidence is similar to that found by De Choudhury et al. [14] who identified depression in approximately 36% of participants. Table 1 gives statistics on the activity histories of participants.

The present study was reviewed and approved by the Harvard University Institutional Review Board approval #15-2529 as well as the University of Vermont Institutional Review Board approval #CHRMS-16-135. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with Institutional Review Board guidelines. All study participants provided informed consent and acknowledged all of the study goals expectations and procedures including data privacy prior to any data collection. Surveys were built using the Qualtrics survey platform and analyses were performed using Python and R. Twitter data collection apps were written in Python using the Twitter developer’s Application Programming Interface (API).
https://aclanthology.org/W14-3214.pdf,Towards Assessing Changes in Degree of Depression through Facebook,Dataset,0,We used a dataset of 28749 nonclinical users who opted into a Facebook application (“MyPersonality”; Kosinski and Stillwell 2012) between June 2009 and March 2011 completed a 100-item personality questionnaire (an International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) proxy to the NEO-PI-R (Goldberg 1999) and shared access to their status updates containing at least 500 words. Users wrote on average of 4236 words (69917624 total word instances) and a subset of 16507 users provided gender and age in which 57.0% were female and the mean age was 24.8. The dataset was divided into training and testing samples. In particular the testing sample consisted of a random set of 1000 users who wrote at least 1000 words and completed the personality measure while the training set contained the 27749 remaining users.
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6784326,Affective and Content Analysis of Online Depression Communities,Data Sets,0,a) CLINICAL Communities: Communities who are interested in ‘depression’ and with at least 200 posts are extracted from LiveJournal. This is identified through the ‘Search communities by interest’2 provided by LiveJournal and results in 24 communities with 38401 posts. The CLINICAL communities are grouped based on name and description of the individual community: depression bipolar self-harm attachment/separation and suicide (See Table 1 for statistics). The earliest community creation date was in 2001 thus our data set spans over 10 years. b) CONTROL communities: We constructed a CONTROL data set using five popular categories of communities in the LiveJournal Directory.3 We select communities who have at least 200 posts resulting in 23 communities with 229563 posts. This set is called CONTROL and the statistics of these 23 communities and their description are shown in Table 2.
https://www.jmir.org/2017/7/e243/,Assessing Suicide Risk and Emotional Distress in Chinese Social Media: A Text Mining and Machine Learning Study,Data Collection,2,A Web-based survey of Weibo users was conducted to assess the respondents’ suicide risk and emotional distress (ie depression anxiety and stress). The invitation letter to participate in this survey was widely sent out to general Weibo users by various promotion activities. For a Weibo user to be eligible for the study she or he had to be 18 years or older (by self-report). A 30 Renminbi incentive for each complete survey was provided to boost the respond rate. With the respondents’ consent their Weibo posts that were posted in the public domain during the 12 months before the survey were downloaded by calling Weibo API. The survey fulfilled the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) checklist and details of the procedure have been reported in previous publications [2232]. In addition when multiple survey feedback were submitted from the same Internet protocol addresses only the first submission was used to avoid duplicate participation. In contrast to a previous study [32] this study excluded those who posted nothing throughout the 12 months but not those who posted fewer than 100 posts. Eventually data provided by 974 respondents remained for further analyses. The study has obtained ethical approvals from the Human Research Ethical Review Committee at the University of Hong Kong and the Institute Review Board of the Institute of Psychology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The survey measured respondents’ suicide probability score depression anxiety stress and Weibo suicide communication (WSC) as the outcome variables. In addition the respondents’ Weibo posts language features were extracted as independent variables or features for machine learning. The details of how those data were obtained are elaborated in the following subsections.
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,A Social Media Based Index of Mental Well-Being in College Campuses,Data,0,We first obtained a list of 150 ranked major universities in the United States by crawling the US News and World Report website [48]. This list is constructed based on the Carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researchers and using a set of 16 indicators of academic excellence defined by US News. The list includes a variety of universities spread across the US in different settings (e.g. urban rural) and with a wide range of student enrollment sizes. Figure 1(a) shows their geographic distribution. As a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata: gender distribution of students average tuition and fees and academic calendar (semester/quarter). To obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the Wikipedia pages of all of the 150 universities. From these pages we extracted the size of student enrollment type (public/private) and setting (rural/suburban/urban/city) at every institution. These definitions come from a formal categorization scheme used by the US Department of Education. The student body enrollment sizes ranged from 2255 to 97494 with 98 public and 52 private universities. 50 universities were reported to be urban 47 city 39 suburban and 13 rural. Finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the universities from a website known as Priceonomics [58]. The website calculates the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) by combining the race/ethnicity distribution of student bodies at different universities with data given from the Department of Education. HHI ranges from 1 (the least diverse: a population of all one type) to 1/N (the most diverse) where N is the number of different racial categories being analyzed. Social Media Data of Universities Next we obtained social media data of the above universities. Specifically we focused on the social media Reddit. Why Reddit? Reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social media site among the college student demographic [23]. Due to its forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing as well as for obtaining feedback and information from communities of interest. Reddit harbors a variety of communities known as “subreddits” including many dedicated to specific university campuses. This allows a large sample of posts shared by students of a university to be collected in one place. Our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits (e.g. r/gatech or r/KState) revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by students to discuss college topics (Table 1). Focusing on these public Reddit communities also does not require explicit data collection efforts to be coordinated at each of the 150 university sites. Although more students are likely to use Facebook due to its largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university’s students. Next while Twitter is also widely adopted without explicit self-reported information it is challenging to identify college student accounts. Finally prior work [2 18] notes that semianonymity of Reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topics like mental health. Initial Data Acquisition. We leveraged the archive of all of Reddit data made available on Google’s BigQuery [11]. BigQuery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third parties to access large publicly available dataset through simple SQL-type queries. Our queries grabbed all posts ranging between June 2011 and February 2016 available in the Reddit data archive. This included 424984 posts from 153378 unique users across all of the 146 universities with a mean of 2910.8 posts ( = 4329.6) and 1050 unique users ( = 1407) per subreddit. Filling the Gaps in Subreddit Data. The second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection. Through Reddit’s official API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) we obtained the most recent number of subscribers in the 146 university subreddits (as of July 2016). Then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data as given in step 1 we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit. This allows us to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative. For subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median (.42) (73 in all) we performed a one-time data collection using the Reddit API. This gave us a set of (at most) 1000 most recent posts for each subreddit with a total of 39824 posts added to the data obtained in step 1 following de-duplication. We note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distributions of data across the subreddits: The skew (yearly rate of change) before and after data filling were 4.86 and 5.05 respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a two-sample equivalence test (p = .013 p = .025) a test that uses two one-sided t-tests on the before-after yearly rates of change from both sides of a chosen difference interval [1 1].
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7752434,MIDAS: Mental illness detection and analysis via social media,Data Collection,0,To train our models we require information from two different types of users: patients and non-patients. Therefore we employed a combined - manual effort and keyword matching - data collection approach to efficiently collect data for these users. For the collection of patients we manually collect the community portals relevant to both mental disorders. 2 From these portals' followers list we select the self-reported users who explicitly state in their profile description that they suffer from a mental illness; i.e. for a given user we are checking if his/her profile contains any keyword related to a target disorder (e.g. “borderline” “bpd” “bipolar”). Non-patients are referred to as random active Twitter users who are not explicitly stating that they are suffering from Bipolar disorder (hereinafter referred to as “BD”) or Borderline Personality Disorder (hereinafter referred to as “BPD”). To obtain these users we randomly sampled Twitter IDs. Thereafter we proceeded to download the tweets from the selected IDs. After the users have been identified we manually label them into one of two categories: 1) Patient: a person who is suffering from a mental disorder 2) Not-related: any user who we don't consider to be a patient. Lastly after having obtained the final list of patients we retrieve their tweets. These steps are applied for the collection of both BPD and BD patient datasets.
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,A deep learning model for detecting mental illness from user content on social media,Data Collection,2,We collected post data from the following six mental-health-related subreddits each of which is reported to be associated with a specific disorder10: r/depression r/Anxiety r/bipolar r/BPD r/schizophrenia and r/autism. In addition we further collected post data from the most popular health-related subreddit17 r/mentalhealth to analyze posts with general health information. From each subreddit we collected all the user IDs who had at least one post related to the mental health. Along with user IDs we also collected titles and posts using the PushshiftAPI18. Note that all the user information is anonymized hence no personally identifiable information was not included; we followed all the anonymization process guided by the Sungkyunkwan University Institutional Review Board (IRB). Overall the current study collected information from 248537 users who wrote 633385 posts in the seven subreddits from January 2017 to December 2018. Table 1 summarizes the information of collected data.
https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,Mental Health Surveillance over Social Media with Digital Cohorts,Mental Health Classifiers,0,We build on prior work on supervised models for mental health inference over social media data. We focus on two mental health conditions — depression and PTSD — and develop classifiers with the self-reported datasets created for CLPysch 2015 (Mitchell et al. 2015; Coppersmith et al. 2015b). These labeled datasets derive from users that have publicly disclosed on Twitter a diagnosis of depression (327 users) or PTSD (246 users) with an equal number of randomly selected demographically-matched (with respect to age and gender) users as controls. For each user the associated metadata and posting history was also collected — up to the 3000 most recent tweets per limitations of the Twitter API. The participants of the task proposed a host of methods ranging from rule-based systems to various supervised models (Pedersen 2015; PreotiucPietro et al. 2015; Coppersmith et al. 2015b). More recently the neural user-level classifier proposed by Amir et al. (2017) showed not only good performance on this task but also the ability to capture implicit similarities between users affected by the same diseases thus opening the door to more interpretable analyses2 . Hence we adopt their model for this analysis.
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67186-4_6,Social Media Mining to Understand Public Mental Health,Data,0,We analyze two datasets: (1) user communities on Reddit and (2) journals from a mental health journalling mobile app. We omit the name of the app for privacy and we refer to it as the “journalling app”. Reddit is a social media platform that was originally used for sharing and rating content such as news documentaries and music. Users post in and subscribe to self-organized communities known as subreddits; subscribing to a subreddit allows a user to view all posts from that subreddit. An advantage of analyzing Reddit data is that the subreddits are labelled according to their topics. Utilizing curated lists from volunteer Reddit users we crawled all subreddits related to mental health as well as all subreddits linked by these communities. The second dataset consists of anonymized journal posts from a mobile app designed to help people track their moods and share them anonymously if they desire. For each journal post the app requires the user to label the journal post with at least one mood selected from a pre-populated list including “happy” “sad” etc. We obtained all journals and the associated moods written between January 2016 and January 2017. This amounts to over 1.2 million journals written by approximately 75000 users. Figure 1 plots the number of journals posted over time. Most of the journals were written in the first half of 2016 although we inspected topic distributions per month and did not find seasonal effects. Towards the beginning of 2016 many new users registered on the app and eventually stopped using it. Like weight-loss and productivity apps we believe this influx is tied to users looking to improve their habits as a New Year’s resolution. Each journal can be set to be private or public (visible to all other users of the app). Roughly one third of all journals are public. Figure 2 plots the number of users on the y-axis versus the percentage of journals they posted publicly. Most users are either mostly private or mostly public. Most journals are relatively short just like Twitter posts that are at most 140 characters. The average length of a journal with text in it is 128 characters; there are roughly 100000 journal that have no text only a mood label. We observed that private users tend to write journals that are slightly but statistically significantly longer than those written by public users by approximately 10 characters. Figure 3 shows the distribution of journal lengths where the spikes correspond to 0 length (mood only) 200 characters (the default limit set by the app) and 300 characters (set as the maximum for visualization purposes). Users of the app can optionally enter their location age and gender. While most users did not enter this information we found that those who revealed their location are mostly from North America those who revealed their gender are predominantly female and those who revealed their age have an average age of 25.
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557214,Seeking and sharing health information online: comparing search engines and social media,Health Information Seeking and Sharing Survey,0,To gain qualitative insight into people’s health information seeking and sharing practices we conducted an online survey during June 2013 using a recruiting service (Cint) that offers “Census representative sampling” in terms of gender and age throughout regions of the U.S. Respondents were paid approximately 4 USD to complete the survey and were required to have a Twitter account to qualify to participate. The survey comprised 37 questions and took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Participants were asked if they had ever sought health information on a search engine such as Google or Bing or on Twitter and whether they had ever shared health information on Twitter. If they answered affirmatively they were asked to describe the most recent occasion on which they did so including the health condition that motivated them to search or share and their objective in performing the activity. The survey included questions about how often participants used search engines and Twitter for various types of information seeking or sharing views about risks associated with each platform and basic demographics. In total 237 respondents completed the survey. After discarding low quality responses (as determined by nonsensical or sarcastic responses to open questions) 210 valid survey responses were analyzed. Of these respondents 53% were female they resided in 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and 43% had a college degree or higher. Ages ranged from 18 to 70 years (median = 35 years). Respondents reported using search engines frequently (76% at least once per day with only 7% using them less than once per week). 71% of respondents had public Twitter accounts while the remaining 29% had “protected” accounts (i.e. only approved followers could view their postings).
https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/viewPaper/8075,Mental Health Discourse on reddit: Self-Disclosure Social Support and Anonymity,Data and Methods,0,reddit is a social news website where registered users submit content in the form of links or text posts. Users also known as “redditors” can then vote each submission “up” or “down” to rank the post and determine its position or prominence on the site’s pages. These two attributes associated with a post are referred to as “upvotes” and “downvotes”. Redditors can also comment on posts and respond back in a conversation tree of comments. Content entries that is the posts are organized by areas of interest or sub-communities called “subreddits” such as politics programming or science. As of 2013 reddit’s official statistics included 56 billion page views 731 million unique visitors 40855032 posts and 404603286 comments (http://blog.reddit.com/2013/ 12/top-posts-of-2013-stats-and-snoo-years.html). We used of reddit’s official API (http://www.reddit.com/ dev /api) to collect posts comments and associated metadata from several mental health subreddits: specifically using a Python wrapper PRAW (https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/ latest/index.html). The subreddits we crawled were: alcoholism anxiety bipolarreddit depression mentalhealth MMFB (Make Me Feel Better) socialanxiety SuicideWatch. All of these subreddits host public content. In order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized reddit’s native subreddit search feature (http://www.reddit.com/reddits) and searched for subreddits on “mental health”. Two researchers familiar with reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search results returned so that we focus on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concerns and issues. Thereafter we focused on a snowball approach in which starting with a few seed subreddits (mentalhealth depression) we compiled a second list of “related” or “similar” subreddits that are listed in the profile pages of the seed subreddits. Following a second filtering step we arrived at the list of subreddits listed above. For each of these subreddits we obtained daily crawls of their posts in the New category. Corresponding to each post we collected information on the title of the post the body or textual content id timestamp when the post was made author id and the number of upvotes and downvotes it obtained. Since posts gather comments over a period of time following the time of sharing we crawled all of the comments per post that were shared over a three day period after the post was made. Qualitative examinations of the subreddits of interest revealed that 90% or more of the comments to any post were typically made in a three day window following the time the post is made—hence the choice. The crawl of the subreddits used in this paper We present some descriptive statistics of our crawled data. Our dataset contained 20411 posts with at least one comment and 97661 comments in all with 27102 unique users who made posts comments or both. A set of 7823 users (28.79%) were found to write both at least one post and comment. CDF of the user distribution over posts and comments is given in Figure 1. The figure shows the expected heavy tail trend observed in several social phenomena. Also see Figure 2 for the distribution of comments over time following post share. It illustrates the quick responsivity culture in the communities we study (peak at 3 hours). Some of the additional statistics of our dataset are given in Table 1. Further example titles of a few
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025932,Modeling and Understanding Visual Attributes of Mental Health Disclosures in Social Media,Ethical Considerations,2,Due to the sensitivities around the topic of investigation in this paper there are many important ethical implications to consider. For this work we used public posts shared on Instagram and we did not have any interaction with the users. Therefore our work did not qualify for approval from the relevant Institutional Review Board. Nevertheless we acknowledge that employing our proposed methods and approaches in the design of the above outlined interventions presents some ethical challenges. How can these automated approaches that are themselves prone to errors be made to act fairly as well as secure one’s privacy their rights on the platforms and their freedom of speech? Further how can we address potential risks of these automated approaches misinterpreting and misrepresenting any of the shared visual or linguistic cues? To address these ethical challenges we propose the following guidelines to be incorporated in the design and deployment of the above proposed interventions and tools: a) Seeking voluntary consent from the population being studied and those likely to benefit from the technologies. b) Partnership with a trained domain expert e.g. a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist so as to ensure that the tools bear potential to extend help and support to individuals engaging in significant mental health disclosures. c) Including extensive privacy and security protocols to protect the individuals being studied starting from collection of social media data to its analysis and modeling and then during the development of the interventions and tools. And d) Adoption of user centered design approaches in intervention and technology development to investigate specific needs and constraints of the target users as well as their acceptability utility and interpretability.
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300996,A content analysis of depression-related tweets,Methods,2,The Twitter data in the current study is public. The study protocol was approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board.
https://aclanthology.org/W15-1202.pdf,Quantifying the Language of Schizophrenia in Social Media,Data,2,We follow the data acquisition and curation process of Coppersmith et al. (2014a) summarizing the major points here: Social media such as Twitter contains frequent public statements by users reporting diagnoses for various medical conditions. Many talk about physical health conditions (e.g. cancer flu) but some also discuss mental illness including schizophrenia. There are a variety of motivations for users to share this information on social media: to offer or seek support to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps to offer an explanation for certain behaviors.4 We obtain messages with these self-reported diagnoses using the Twitter API and filtered via (caseinsensitive) regular expression to require “schizo” or a close phonetic approximation to be present; our expression matched “schizophrenia” its subtypes and various approximations: “schizo” “skitzo” “skitso” “schizotypal” “schizoid” etc. All data we collect are public posts made between 2008 and 2015 and exclude any message marked as ‘private’ by the author. All use of the data reported in this paper has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB). Each self-stated diagnosis included in this study was examined by a human annotator (one of the authors) to verify that it appeared to be a genuine statement of a schizophrenia diagnosis excluding jokes quotes or disingenuous statements. We obtained 174 users with an apparently genuine selfstated diagnosis of a schizophrenia-related condition. Note that we cannot be certain that the Twitter user was actually diagnosed with schizophrenia only that their statement of being diagnosed appears to be genuine. Previous work indicates that interannotator agreement for this task is good: κ = 0.77 (Coppersmith et al. 2014a). For each user we obtained a set of their public Twitter posts via the Twitter API collecting up to 3200 tweets.5 As we wish to focus on user-authored content we exclude from analysis all retweets and any tweets that contain a URL (which often contain text that the user did not author). We lowercase all words and convert any non-standard characters (including emoji) to a systematic ASCII representation via Unidecode.6 For our community controls we used randomlyselected Twitter users who primarily tweet in English. Specifically during a two week period in early 2014 each Twitter user who was included in Twitter’s 1% “spritzer” sample had an equal chance for inclusion in our pool of community controls. We then collected some of their historic tweets and assessed the language(s) they tweeted in according to the Chromium Compact Language Detector.7 Users were excluded from our community controls if their tweets were less than 75% English.8

Given the sensitive nature of this research we took care to anonymize the data in analysis and presentation so as to minimize any inadvertent disclosure of personal information or information that may reveal cues about an individual’s online identity. Approval was obtained from the relevant institutional review boards.
https://aclanthology.org/W17-3110.pdf,Small but Mighty: Affective Micropatterns for Quantifying Mental Health from Social Media Language,Ethics and Privacy,0,We gave careful consideration to the ethics and privacy surrounding this work and employed the ethical guidelines from Benton et al. (2017) and used social media data donated with consent for use in mental health research from OurDataHelps.Org. We strongly encourage researchers interested in working in this space to consider the ethical implications from the outset both of the research itself and also for the possible resultant technology. Recently Mikal et al. (2016) conducted focus groups around their perception of this vein of work which has greatly informed our work and we heartily recommend it for informing ethical discussions.

Nevertheless we took greater care in de-identifying and paraphrasing any content we present as examples to support our investigation. Importantly our work does not make any diagnostic claims about mental illness experiences of the population we study

https://aclanthology.org/W18-0608.pdf,Cross-cultural differences in language markers of depression online,Data Collection,0,Data was collected from 7 Cups of Tea an anonymous online chat-based peer support community for emotional distress1 . Users agree at signup that their data may be used for the purposes of research. All the data used for the current study was anonymous and securely stored. This research was performed in line with the ethical and privacy protocols outlined in detail in (Benton et al. 2017). Data from 7 Cups takes the form of written dialogue between users of the service and volunteers who are trained as “active listeners”. A fragment of an exchange between the user of the service (U) and the volunteer (V) might go as follows: For the analyses reported in this paper we used only text generated by users of the service not the volunteers providing peer support. Users who reported depression as their primary concern at sign up were eligible for inclusion in analyses. Our original sample was comprised of 23048 conversations involving 1937 unique users. Users were excluded from the sample if they did not indicate their culture or if they selected ‘Other’. This resulted in the exclusion of 199 and 130 users respectively. The original sample also included users identifying as Native American or American Indian. This group was excluded from analyses since the majority of the data among these users was not English. This resulted in the removal of 15 users leaving a total sample size of 1593.

Additionally all work was approved by our institution’s Institutional Review Board.
https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2197-z,Automatic extraction of informal topics from online suicidal ideation,Suicide Watch,0,In this section we first present the data gathered and used in our analysis. Researchers interested in the code and the data are invited to contact the authors. Reddit is a website which enables users to aggregate rate and discuss news entertainment politics and many other topics. According to Alexa it is the 8th most popular website in the world. It was estimated by the Pew research center that 6% of online adults use Reddit [26]. The site is organized into a collection of “subreddits” each focused on a particular topic and administered by a collection of moderators. The subreddit r/SuicideWatch is a forum in which online users are encouraged to post their thoughts regarding suicide. At the time of our data collection it had over 58000 subscribers. Sometimes users express a preoccupation with the thought of suicide. Other times users discuss immediate plans to take their own life. These posts often contain a description of their mental state including depression reaction to stress their feelings of being alone and having a low self-esteem. While most online sources of data are notoriously noisy this particular subreddit is remarkably clean. Given the serious nature of the subreddit individuals are less likely to post harassing comments or off-topic remarks. When users post such comments the moderators of the subreddit quickly remove them. We collected all posts from its inception in 2008 to 2016. Each post is often commented on by other individuals. In this work we focused on the original post as it most often represents the suicidal ideation of a user and comments often represent emotional support from other users. We cleaned this data. First we removed empty posts in which the content had been deleted. Second we removed links and replaced them with the word “link”. Third we concatenated the text of the post to the title as many users begin their post in the title and continue in the body of the post. Finally we removed punctuation and other special characters. After cleaning this data we had 131728 posts with 27978246 words of which 84607 words were unique posted by 63252 unique users.
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8609647,Online Social Networks in Health Care: A Study of Mental Disorders on Reddit,Dataset,0,Reddit is a multilingual Online Social Network founded in 2005 and organized in subcommunities by areas of interest called subreddits. We obtained data from the Reddit's data repository4 focusing on four subreddits where people discuss issues related to mental heath disorders: Depression (/r/depression) Suicide Watch (/r/Suicide Watch) Anxiety (/r/anxiety) and Bipolar (/r/bipolar). Our dataset is comprised of user activities (posts and comments) that took place between 2011 and 201 7. Here we focus on data from January 2017 to December 2017. In total we obtained 261511 posts and 1256669 comments from 184708 unique users. Table I shows the total number of users posts and comments per subreddit. The total number of comments in each community is at least 4.2 times larger than the number of posts which suggests a supportive behavior among users.
