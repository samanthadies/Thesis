https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12961-9,Forecasting the onset and course of mental illness with Twitter data,Participant Safety and Privacy,1,Abstract; introduction; improvements and novel contributions; comparison with trained healthcare professionals; method; data collection; inclusion criteria; participant safety and privacy; improving data quality; summary statistics; feature extraction; units of observation; statistical framework; machine learning models; time series analysis; word shift graphs; results; machine learning classifier; word shift graphs; discussion;,This study design raised two important issues regarding ethical research practices as it concerned both individuals with mental illness and potentially personally identifiable information. We were unable to guarantee strict anonymity to participants given that usernames and personal information posted to Twitter are often inherently specific to participants’ identities (such as usernames and tweets containing real names). As we potentially had the capacity to link study participants’ identities to sensitive health information study participants were informed of the risks of being personally identified from their social media data. Participants were assured that no personal identifiers including usernames would ever be made public or published in any format. We used Turk Prime an interface for conducting MTurk studies to mask participants’ MTurk worker IDs from our records. We made it clear that any links between social media data and private personal health data would be available only to our team of researchers and participants were able to request to have their data removed at any time.

https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,Mental Health Surveillance over Social Media with Digital Cohorts,Privacy and Ethical Considerations,2,Abstract; introduction; methodology; building digital cohorts; age; gender; race/ethnicity; location; mental health classifiers; analysis; discussion; conclusions; privacy and ethical considerations,The majority of social media analysis approaches try to extract signals from individual posts and thus do not need to record any personal information. However as we start moving towards userlevel analyses we are collecting and storing complete records of social media users communications. Even though this information is publicly available people might not be consciously aware of the implications of sharing all their data and certainly have not given explicit consent for their data to be analyzed in aggregate. This is even more pertinent for analyses involving sensitive information (e.g. health related issues). As it has been demonstrated by the recent incidents involving companies inadvertently sharing or failing to protect users personal data there is a serious danger of abuse and exploitation for systems that collect and store large amounts of personal data. Even though this is in large part an ethical question there are technical solutions that can be used to partially address this issue. One is to use anonymization techniques to obfuscate any details that allow third parties (even analysts) to identify the individuals that are involved in the study. Another is to store only abstract representations — which can still be updated and consumed by predictive models —  and discard the actual content. In regards to consent there are initiatives to support voluntary data donation for research purposes e.g. the Our Data Helps program6 .

For this work we used public posts shared on Instagram and we did not have any interaction with the users. Therefore our work did not qualify for approval from the relevant Institutional Review Board. Nevertheless we acknowledge that employing our proposed methods and approaches in the design of the above outlined interventions presents some ethical challenges. How can these automated approaches that are themselves prone to errors be made to act fairly as well as secure one’s privacy their rights on the platforms and their freedom of speech? Further how can we address potential risks of these automated approaches misinterpreting and misrepresenting any of the shared visual or linguistic cues? To address these ethical challenges we propose the following guidelines to be incorporated in the design and deployment of the above proposed interventions and tools: a) Seeking voluntary consent from the population being studied and those likely to benefit from the technologies. b) Partnership with a trained domain expert e.g. a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist so as to ensure that the tools bear potential to extend help and support to individuals engaging in significant mental health disclosures. c) Including extensive privacy and security protocols to protect the individuals being studied starting from collection of social media data to its analysis and modeling and then during the development of the interventions and tools. And d) Adoption of user centered design approaches in intervention and technology development to investigate specific needs and constraints of the target users as well as their acceptability utility and interpretability.

(2017) and used social media data donated with consent for use in mental health research from OurDataHelps.Org. We strongly encourage researchers interested in working in this space to consider the ethical implications from the outset both of the research itself and also for the possible resultant technology. Recently Mikal et al. (2016) conducted focus groups around their perception of this vein of work which has greatly informed our work and we heartily recommend it for informing ethical discussions.
