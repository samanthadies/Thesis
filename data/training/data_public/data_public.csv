Separate surveys were created for depressed and healthy individuals. In the depressed survey participants were invited to complete a survey that involved passing a series of inclusion criteria responding to a standardized clinical depression survey answering questions related to demographics and history of depression and sharing social media history. We used the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) questionnaire to screen participant depression levels []. CES-D assessment quality has been demonstrated as on-par with other depression inventories including the Beck Depression Inventory and the Kellner Symptom Questionnaire [ ]. Healthy participants were screened to ensure no history of depression and active Instagram use. See Additional file  for actual survey text. Qualified participants were asked to share their Instagram usernames and history. An app embedded in the survey allowed participants to securely log into their Instagram accounts and agree to share their data.b Upon securing consent we made a one-time collection of participants’ entire Instagram posting history. In total we collected  photographs from  Instagram users  of whom had a history of depression. We asked a different set of MTurk crowdworkers to rate the Instagram photographs collected. This new task asked participants to rate a random selection of  photos from the data we collected. Raters were asked to judge how interesting likable happy and sad each photo seemed on a continuous - scale. Each photo was rated by at least three different raters and ratings were averaged across raters. Raters were not informed that photos were from Instagram nor were they given any information about the study participants who provided the photos including mental health status. Each ratings category showed good inter-rater agreement. Only a subset of participant Instagram photos were rated (N = ). We limited ratings data to a subset because this task was time-consuming for crowdworkers and so proved a costly form of data collection. For the depressed sample ratings were only made for photos posted within a year in either direction of the date of first depression diagnosis. Within this subset for each user the nearest  posts prior to the diagnosis date were rated. For the control population the most recent  photos from each user’s date of participation in this study were rated.,

Personally identifiable information was removed and content was de-identified and paraphrased before being reported in the paper for exemplary purposes. This work has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB). Our work does not make any diagnostic claims related to mental illness or suicide.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702613.2732733,Detecting and Characterizing Mental Health Related Self-Disclosure in Social Media,Data Collection,2,We used Reddit's official API to collect posts comments on posts and associated metadata from several mental health focused subreddits. We build on the data collection methodology we used in [4]. In order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized Reddit's native subreddit search feature (http://www.reddit.com/reddits). We searched for subreddits on “mental health”. Two researchers familiar with Reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search results returned so that we “seed” on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concerns. Thereafter we focused on a snowball approach to compile a second list of “related” or “similar” subreddits that are mentioned in the profile pages of the seed subreddits. Sample of subreddits (31 in all) we crawled are given in Table 1. Note all of these subreddits host public content. For the purposes of self-disclosure detection we also identified subreddits (sample listed in Table 2) as our control group (total of 12 subreddits) – meaning they are unrelated to mental health topics. For sanity check we randomly sampled a set of 200 posts from the control subreddits and two researchers familiar with Reddit manually checked their content for presence of any mental health content. We found that 97% of subreddit content in our sample were not about any mental health concern (Cohen’s Kappa for inter-rater agreement was .84). In all our dataset had 32509 posts from 23807 users in the mental health subreddits and 15383 posts from 13216 users in the control forums. For each of the unique users in the mental health forums we further collected all of their Reddit post/comment histories (last 1000 posts/comments per Reddit API limits) if their number of posts and comments in our dataset was five or more – this gave us 7248 users and 4.1M posts/comments,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702280,Recognizing Depression from Twitter Activity,Data Gathering,0,In this study we gathered information on depression levels of Twitter users and their activity histories. To do this we published a website to administer a questionnaire and disseminated information about the website over Twitter1. In contrast to De Choudhury et al. [14] who collected data from Englishspeaking users through crowdsourcing this study collected data from Japanese-speaking volunteers. This approach was used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research [14]. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of our website. The website collected the responses to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the Twitter users who participated (hereinafter the participants) and to collect the histories of participants activities on Twitter. The activity histories of participants were collected through the Twitter application programming interface (API)2 and the questionnaires to determine degree of depression were completed by participants through their web browsers. Before data collection visitors to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aims of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled. Those who consented to become participants after receiving the explanation logged into their individual Twitter accounts through the OAuth authorization process. Next participants were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression. A message called the “kokoro score” (“kokoro” is a Japanese word meaning “heart”) determined on the basis of answers to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweets was displayed to participants after completion of the questionnaire (Fig. 2). Experiment participants were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over Twitter by word-of-mouth in a type of snowball sampling. The CES-D questionnaire was used to evaluate the degree of depression [30]. In the CES-D test participants answered 20 questions on a Likert-type 4-point scale. Each answer was assigned a score of 0-3 points with the sum of the points from all answers used as the score to estimate likelihood of depression. Several standards exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression. In this research we regarded a score of 22 points or higher as indicating active depression and a score of 21 points or lower as indicating no active depression; these are the same values as used in [14] and give a cutoff score of 22. In addition answers to BDI [2] a depression scale used with characteristics similar to CESD were collected to ensure the reliability of data. For each participant scores were calculated on both scales with poor correlation regarded as indicating unreliable answers. The time taken to answer the questionnaires was also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded. After each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on Twitter was collected from Twitter by using the API. At most 3200 tweets were collected for each participant and the number of users following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded. Tweets published after the questionnaire was taken were discarded. The website was opened to the public on 4 December 2013 at which time the authors publicized it on their Twitter accounts. Between 4 December 2013 and 8 February 2014 219 people participated in the experiment. After eliminating participants who did not tweet and participants who answered the questionnaire in fewer than 30 seconds (as previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answers) 214 sets of answers remained. Only the first set of answers was used for participants who completed the questionnaire more than once. As a result data about 209 experiment participants (male: 121; female: 88) aged 16 to 55 (mean: 28.8 years; standard deviation: 8.2 years) were analyzed. The correlations between CES-D score and BDI score for these participants were high 0.87 and there were no participants with uncorrelated scores so the data for all 209 participants were used; excluded datasets are not discussed any further. Figure 3 shows the histogram of CES-D scores of 209 participants. Among the participants 81 (resp. 128) were estimated to have (resp. not have) active depression for an incidence of approximately 39%. This incidence is similar to that found by De Choudhury et al. [14] who identified depression in approximately 36% of participants. Table 1 gives statistics on the activity histories of participants.,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12961-9,Forecasting the onset and course of mental illness with Twitter data,Data Collection,0,Data was collected from 7 Cups of Tea an anonymous online chat-based peer support community for emotional distress1 . Users agree at signup that their data may be used for the purposes of research. All the data used for the current study was anonymous and securely stored. This research was performed in line with the ethical and privacy protocols outlined in detail in (Benton et al. 2017). Data from 7 Cups takes the form of written dialogue between users of the service and volunteers who are trained as “active listeners”. A fragment of an exchange between the user of the service (U) and the volunteer (V) might go as follows: For the analyses reported in this paper we used only text generated by users of the service not the volunteers providing peer support. Users who reported depression as their primary concern at sign up were eligible for inclusion in analyses. Our original sample was comprised of 23048 conversations involving 1937 unique users. Users were excluded from the sample if they did not indicate their culture or if they selected ‘Other’. This resulted in the exclusion of 199 and 130 users respectively. The original sample also included users identifying as Native American or American Indian. This group was excluded from analyses since the majority of the data among these users was not English. This resulted in the removal of 15 users leaving a total sample size of 1593.,
https://aclanthology.org/W14-3214.pdf,Towards Assessing Changes in Degree of Depression through Facebook,Dataset,0,We used a dataset of 28749 nonclinical users who opted into a Facebook application (“MyPersonality”; Kosinski and Stillwell 2012) between June 2009 and March 2011 completed a 100-item personality questionnaire (an International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) proxy to the NEO-PI-R (Goldberg 1999) and shared access to their status updates containing at least 500 words. Users wrote on average of 4236 words (69917624 total word instances) and a subset of 16507 users provided gender and age in which 57.0% were female and the mean age was 24.8. The dataset was divided into training and testing samples. In particular the testing sample consisted of a random set of 1000 users who wrote at least 1000 words and completed the personality measure while the training set contained the 27749 remaining users.,
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6784326,Affective and Content Analysis of Online Depression Communities,Data Sets,0,a) CLINICAL Communities: Communities who are interested in ‘depression’ and with at least 200 posts are extracted from LiveJournal. This is identified through the ‘Search communities by interest’2 provided by LiveJournal and results in 24 communities with 38401 posts. The CLINICAL communities are grouped based on name and description of the individual community: depression bipolar self-harm attachment/separation and suicide (See Table 1 for statistics). The earliest community creation date was in 2001 thus our data set spans over 10 years. b) CONTROL communities: We constructed a CONTROL data set using five popular categories of communities in the LiveJournal Directory.3 We select communities who have at least 200 posts resulting in 23 communities with 229563 posts. This set is called CONTROL and the statistics of these 23 communities and their description are shown in Table 2.,
https://www.jmir.org/2017/7/e243/,Assessing Suicide Risk and Emotional Distress in Chinese Social Media: A Text Mining and Machine Learning Study,Data Collection,2,A Web-based survey of Weibo users was conducted to assess the respondents’ suicide risk and emotional distress (ie depression anxiety and stress). The invitation letter to participate in this survey was widely sent out to general Weibo users by various promotion activities. For a Weibo user to be eligible for the study she or he had to be 18 years or older (by self-report). A 30 Renminbi incentive for each complete survey was provided to boost the respond rate. With the respondents’ consent their Weibo posts that were posted in the public domain during the 12 months before the survey were downloaded by calling Weibo API. The survey fulfilled the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) checklist and details of the procedure have been reported in previous publications [2232]. In addition when multiple survey feedback were submitted from the same Internet protocol addresses only the first submission was used to avoid duplicate participation. In contrast to a previous study [32] this study excluded those who posted nothing throughout the 12 months but not those who posted fewer than 100 posts. Eventually data provided by 974 respondents remained for further analyses. The study has obtained ethical approvals from the Human Research Ethical Review Committee at the University of Hong Kong and the Institute Review Board of the Institute of Psychology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The survey measured respondents’ suicide probability score depression anxiety stress and Weibo suicide communication (WSC) as the outcome variables. In addition the respondents’ Weibo posts language features were extracted as independent variables or features for machine learning. The details of how those data were obtained are elaborated in the following subsections.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,A Social Media Based Index of Mental Well-Being in College Campuses,Data  ,2,We first obtained a list of 150 ranked major universities in the United States by crawling the US News and World Report website [48]. This list is constructed based on the Carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researchers and using a set of 16 indicators of academic excellence defined by US News. The list includes a variety of universities spread across the US in different settings (e.g. urban rural) and with a wide range of student enrollment sizes. Figure 1(a) shows their geographic distribution. As a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata: gender distribution of students average tuition and fees and academic calendar (semester/quarter). To obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the Wikipedia pages of all of the 150 universities. From these pages we extracted the size of student enrollment type (public/private) and setting (rural/suburban/urban/city) at every institution. These definitions come from a formal categorization scheme used by the US Department of Education. The student body enrollment sizes ranged from 2255 to 97494 with 98 public and 52 private universities. 50 universities were reported to be urban 47 city 39 suburban and 13 rural. Finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the universities from a website known as Priceonomics [58]. The website calculates the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) by combining the race/ethnicity distribution of student bodies at different universities with data given from the Department of Education. HHI ranges from 1 (the least diverse: a population of all one type) to 1/N (the most diverse) where N is the number of different racial categories being analyzed. Social Media Data of Universities Next we obtained social media data of the above universities. Specifically we focused on the social media Reddit. Why Reddit? Reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social media site among the college student demographic [23]. Due to its forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing as well as for obtaining feedback and information from communities of interest. Reddit harbors a variety of communities known as “subreddits” including many dedicated to specific university campuses. This allows a large sample of posts shared by students of a university to be collected in one place. Our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits (e.g. r/gatech or r/KState) revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by students to discuss college topics (Table 1). Focusing on these public Reddit communities also does not require explicit data collection efforts to be coordinated at each of the 150 university sites. Although more students are likely to use Facebook due to its largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university’s students. Next while Twitter is also widely adopted without explicit self-reported information it is challenging to identify college student accounts. Finally prior work [2 18] notes that semianonymity of Reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topics like mental health. Initial Data Acquisition. We leveraged the archive of all of Reddit data made available on Google’s BigQuery [11]. BigQuery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third parties to access large publicly available dataset through simple SQL-type queries. Our queries grabbed all posts ranging between June 2011 and February 2016 available in the Reddit data archive. This included 424984 posts from 153378 unique users across all of the 146 universities with a mean of 2910.8 posts ( = 4329.6) and 1050 unique users ( = 1407) per subreddit. Filling the Gaps in Subreddit Data. The second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection. Through Reddit’s official API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) we obtained the most recent number of subscribers in the 146 university subreddits (as of July 2016). Then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data as given in step 1 we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit. This allows us to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative. For subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median (.42) (73 in all) we performed a one-time data collection using the Reddit API. This gave us a set of (at most) 1000 most recent posts for each subreddit with a total of 39824 posts added to the data obtained in step 1 following de-duplication. We note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distributions of data across the subreddits: The skew (yearly rate of change) before and after data filling were 4.86 and 5.05 respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a two-sample equivalence test (p = .013 p = .025) a test that uses two one-sided t-tests on the before-after yearly rates of change from both sides of a chosen difference interval [1 1].,
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7752434,MIDAS: Mental illness detection and analysis via social media,Data Collection,0,To train our models we require information from two different types of users: patients and non-patients. Therefore we employed a combined - manual effort and keyword matching - data collection approach to efficiently collect data for these users. For the collection of patients we manually collect the community portals relevant to both mental disorders. 2 From these portals' followers list we select the self-reported users who explicitly state in their profile description that they suffer from a mental illness; i.e. for a given user we are checking if his/her profile contains any keyword related to a target disorder (e.g. “borderline” “bpd” “bipolar”). Non-patients are referred to as random active Twitter users who are not explicitly stating that they are suffering from Bipolar disorder (hereinafter referred to as “BD”) or Borderline Personality Disorder (hereinafter referred to as “BPD”). To obtain these users we randomly sampled Twitter IDs. Thereafter we proceeded to download the tweets from the selected IDs. After the users have been identified we manually label them into one of two categories: 1) Patient: a person who is suffering from a mental disorder 2) Not-related: any user who we don't consider to be a patient. Lastly after having obtained the final list of patients we retrieve their tweets. These steps are applied for the collection of both BPD and BD patient datasets.,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,A deep learning model for detecting mental illness from user content on social media,Discussion,2,Detecting mental illness problems in early stages and providing appropriate solutions can help potential mental disorder sufferers23. By collecting and analyzing data from mental-health-related subreddits in Reddit that focus on mental disorder issues we introduced a deep learning model with natural language processing methods to identify the users with potential mental illness based on their posts. We believe that our method can open up a new research era where online social media can play a role as an efficient source for identifying potential mental illness based on users’ specific posts24. However a majority of people who may have mental illness are still in social blind spots and lacks appropriate treatment due to several reasons such as difficulty in revealing their status to someone in person or having difficulties in physically accessing the clinics23. Based on the lessons learned the following implications are presented. First deep learning approaches with appropriate natural language processing methods can be used to detect users’ potential mental illnesses by their posts. With the employment of easily accessible social media data the approaches used in this study can be adopted to alert the users who may be suffered from specific mental disorders before they visit counseling centers. Second this study provides notable evidence supporting the possibility of utilizing online platforms that can help people in need of mental treatment. Specifically for example online platform service providers may ask a user’s consent first to access one’s account and if agreed can provide the probabilities of each mental disorder predicted through our validated models based on the user’s posts. Lastly the current study suggests detecting mental illness in social media can be a prominent research area in the future. The findings of the current study reveal the potential for social media platforms that can play a role in providing a space to interact with others who are suffered by mental disorder. However there are a few limitations in this study. The current study did not consider several factors (e.g. socio-demographic and regional differences) that could affect the classification models. These factors can be considered in future research which can improve the quality or accuracy of the deep learning models. In addition we collected the data from the public social media Reddit which may be different from the personal feed of social network services in expressing users’ emotions. We did not conduct additional validation procedures of our model with another independent dataset as mentioned above which would need to be further investigated. Although postings in online social media could not explicitly tell the symptoms compared to posts in users’ personal pages that may say they are diagnosed with clinical mental illnesses online social media have a potential to be used to identify mental disorder sufferers because they share their symptoms relatively accurately under the semi-anonymity system. Also we trained our model on a specific mental state to directly classify the symptom and provide the predicted probabilities for each symptom. In this way we could not accurately measure the co-morbid mental illness status which is left for future work. In future study we could adopt an ensemble approach with our multiple binary classification models which can be utilized to identify the real-world mental conditions such as co-morbid illness. We also plan to validate our proposed model in posts of users who may have uncertain mental disease in other social network services such as Facebook or Twitter. In addition a time-series user-level analysis that tracks a users’ longitudinal behavior pattern can help to develop a user-level detection model for mental illness using a recurrent neural network. Based on the lessons learned the following implications are presented. First deep learning approaches with appropriate natural language processing methods can be used to detect users’ potential mental illnesses by their posts.

https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,Mental Health Surveillance over Social Media with Digital Cohorts,Privacy and Ethical Considerations,1,The majority of social media analysis approaches try to extract signals from individual posts and thus do not need to record any personal information. However as we start moving towards userlevel analyses we are collecting and storing complete records of social media users communications. Even though this information is publicly available people might not be consciously aware of the implications of sharing all their data and certainly have not given explicit consent for their data to be analyzed in aggregate. This is even more pertinent for analyses involving sensitive information (e.g. health related issues). As it has been demonstrated by the recent incidents involving companies inadvertently sharing or failing to protect users personal data there is a serious danger of abuse and exploitation for systems that collect and store large amounts of personal data. Even though this is in large part an ethical question there are technical solutions that can be used to partially address this issue. One is to use anonymization techniques to obfuscate any details that allow third parties (even analysts) to identify the individuals that are involved in the study. Another is to store only abstract representations — which can still be updated and consumed by predictive models —  and discard the actual content. In regards to consent there are initiatives to support voluntary data donation for research purposes e.g. the Our Data Helps program6 .,
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67186-4_6,Social Media Mining to Understand Public Mental Health,Data,2,We analyze two datasets: (1) user communities on Reddit and (2) journals from a mental health journalling mobile app. We omit the name of the app for privacy and we refer to it as the “journalling app”. Reddit is a social media platform that was originally used for sharing and rating content such as news documentaries and music. Users post in and subscribe to self-organized communities known as subreddits; subscribing to a subreddit allows a user to view all posts from that subreddit. An advantage of analyzing Reddit data is that the subreddits are labelled according to their topics. Utilizing curated lists from volunteer Reddit users we crawled all subreddits related to mental health as well as all subreddits linked by these communities. The second dataset consists of anonymized journal posts from a mobile app designed to help people track their moods and share them anonymously if they desire. For each journal post the app requires the user to label the journal post with at least one mood selected from a pre-populated list including “happy” “sad” etc. We obtained all journals and the associated moods written between January 2016 and January 2017. This amounts to over 1.2 million journals written by approximately 75000 users. Figure 1 plots the number of journals posted over time. Most of the journals were written in the first half of 2016 although we inspected topic distributions per month and did not find seasonal effects. Towards the beginning of 2016 many new users registered on the app and eventually stopped using it. Like weight-loss and productivity apps we believe this influx is tied to users looking to improve their habits as a New Year’s resolution. Each journal can be set to be private or public (visible to all other users of the app). Roughly one third of all journals are public. Figure 2 plots the number of users on the y-axis versus the percentage of journals they posted publicly. Most users are either mostly private or mostly public. Most journals are relatively short just like Twitter posts that are at most 140 characters. The average length of a journal with text in it is 128 characters; there are roughly 100000 journal that have no text only a mood label. We observed that private users tend to write journals that are slightly but statistically significantly longer than those written by public users by approximately 10 characters. Figure 3 shows the distribution of journal lengths where the spikes correspond to 0 length (mood only) 200 characters (the default limit set by the app) and 300 characters (set as the maximum for visualization purposes). Users of the app can optionally enter their location age and gender. While most users did not enter this information we found that those who revealed their location are mostly from North America those who revealed their gender are predominantly female and those who revealed their age have an average age of 25.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557214,Seeking and sharing health information online: comparing search engines and social media,Log Data Collection,2,We focus on the social media platform Twitter a popular microblogging service used by 18% of U.S. Internet users and whose popularity continues to increase [28]. Twitter is particularly interesting to study since nearly all posts are public; the public nature of tweets provides an interesting counterpoint to the private nature of search engine activity. We gathered a 15-month sample of Twitter’s Firehose stream (which includes all public tweets) between November 1 2011 and March 31 2013 made available to us under contract focusing on English-language tweets. Twitter post count and unique user count were computed for each condition and aggregated over the full time period. Specifically we considered a post to belong to a certain health condition if there was a regular expression match of the condition to the text of the post (this would not permit substring matches within terms). To reduce noise we excluded posts that were retweets or contained hyperlinks since they were likely related to general news and not a user’s personal health. Using this method we obtained 125166549 tweets on the 165 health conditions from 62269225 users in the time period of interest. The median number of posts was 51687 per condition from a median of 40152 users per condition.,
https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/viewPaper/8075,Mental Health Discourse on reddit: Self-Disclosure Social Support and Anonymity,Data and Methods,2,reddit is a social news website where registered users submit content in the form of links or text posts. Users also known as “redditors” can then vote each submission “up” or “down” to rank the post and determine its position or prominence on the site’s pages. These two attributes associated with a post are referred to as “upvotes” and “downvotes”. Redditors can also comment on posts and respond back in a conversation tree of comments. Content entries that is the posts are organized by areas of interest or sub-communities called “subreddits” such as politics programming or science. As of 2013 reddit’s official statistics included 56 billion page views 731 million unique visitors 40855032 posts and 404603286 comments (http://blog.reddit.com/2013/ 12/top-posts-of-2013-stats-and-snoo-years.html). We used of reddit’s official API (http://www.reddit.com/ dev /api) to collect posts comments and associated metadata from several mental health subreddits: specifically using a Python wrapper PRAW (https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/ latest/index.html). The subreddits we crawled were: alcoholism anxiety bipolarreddit depression mentalhealth MMFB (Make Me Feel Better) socialanxiety SuicideWatch. All of these subreddits host public content. In order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized reddit’s native subreddit search feature (http://www.reddit.com/reddits) and searched for subreddits on “mental health”. Two researchers familiar with reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search results returned so that we focus on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concerns and issues. Thereafter we focused on a snowball approach in which starting with a few seed subreddits (mentalhealth depression) we compiled a second list of “related” or “similar” subreddits that are listed in the profile pages of the seed subreddits. Following a second filtering step we arrived at the list of subreddits listed above. For each of these subreddits we obtained daily crawls of their posts in the New category. Corresponding to each post we collected information on the title of the post the body or textual content id timestamp when the post was made author id and the number of upvotes and downvotes it obtained. Since posts gather comments over a period of time following the time of sharing we crawled all of the comments per post that were shared over a three day period after the post was made. Qualitative examinations of the subreddits of interest revealed that 90% or more of the comments to any post were typically made in a three day window following the time the post is made—hence the choice. The crawl of the subreddits used in this paper We present some descriptive statistics of our crawled data. Our dataset contained 20411 posts with at least one comment and 97661 comments in all with 27102 unique users who made posts comments or both. A set of 7823 users (28.79%) were found to write both at least one post and comment. CDF of the user distribution over posts and comments is given in Figure 1. The figure shows the expected heavy tail trend observed in several social phenomena. Also see Figure 2 for the distribution of comments over time following post share. It illustrates the quick responsivity culture in the communities we study (peak at 3 hours). Some of the additional statistics of our dataset are given in Table 1. Further example titles of a few,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025932,Modeling and Understanding Visual Attributes of Mental Health Disclosures in Social Media,Data Collection Ethical Limitations,2,We utilized Instagram’s official API1 to obtain the dataset used in this paper. Each post in this dataset is public and contains post-related information such as the image caption likes comments hashtags filter and geolocation if tagged. Referring to prior literature [10] we adopted an iterative approach to first identify a set of appropriate distinguishing hashtags around different prominent mental illnesses prevalent in social media. With the seed tags we performed an initial data collection of 1.5 million posts shared on Instagram between Dec 2010 and Nov 2015. Then by leveraging an association rule mining approach we compiled the top k (k = 39 frequency ≥ 5000) co-occurring tags in the 1.5M posts and then appended them to the original seed tag list for further data collection. Table 1 lists a sample set of tags used to crawl the dataset. This final list of 45 tags was thereafter passed on to a psychiatry researcher to be categorized into different disorder types. For tags that described experiences or symptoms crosscutting across different conditions (e.g. “anxiety”) they were counted toward each disorder type. Table 2 gives a list of the ten different disorders identified in our data. We additionally consulted the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-V [5]) that indicates these disorders to be prominent mental health challenges in populations. This categorization of the mental health challenges was conducted to ensure that our data used in the ensuing analysis focused on well-validated and clinically recognized conditions. At the same time it allowed us to focus on a diverse range of disorders expressed on social media rather than specific ones studied in prior work [12 13 27]; thus enabling us to discover generalized patterns in visual disclosures of mental health challenges in social media. Our final crawl included 2757044 posts from 151638 users spanning these disorders.,Due to the sensitivities around the topic of investigation in this paper there are many important ethical implications to consider. For this work we used public posts shared on Instagram and we did not have any interaction with the users. Therefore our work did not qualify for approval from the relevant Institutional Review Board. Nevertheless we acknowledge that employing our proposed methods and approaches in the design of the above outlined interventions presents some ethical challenges. How can these automated approaches that are themselves prone to errors be made to act fairly as well as secure one’s privacy their rights on the platforms and their freedom of speech? Further how can we address potential risks of these automated approaches misinterpreting and misrepresenting any of the shared visual or linguistic cues? To address these ethical challenges we propose the following guidelines to be incorporated in the design and deployment of the above proposed interventions and tools: a) Seeking voluntary consent from the population being studied and those likely to benefit from the technologies. b) Partnership with a trained domain expert e.g. a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist so as to ensure that the tools bear potential to extend help and support to individuals engaging in significant mental health disclosures. c) Including extensive privacy and security protocols to protect the individuals being studied starting from collection of social media data to its analysis and modeling and then during the development of the interventions and tools. And d) Adoption of user centered design approaches in intervention and technology development to investigate specific needs and constraints of the target users as well as their acceptability utility and interpretability.

https://aclanthology.org/W15-1202.pdf,Quantifying the Language of Schizophrenia in Social Media,Data,2,We follow the data acquisition and curation process of Coppersmith et al. (2014a) summarizing the major points here: Social media such as Twitter contains frequent public statements by users reporting diagnoses for various medical conditions. Many talk about physical health conditions (e.g. cancer flu) but some also discuss mental illness including schizophrenia. There are a variety of motivations for users to share this information on social media: to offer or seek support to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps to offer an explanation for certain behaviors.4 We obtain messages with these self-reported diagnoses using the Twitter API and filtered via (caseinsensitive) regular expression to require “schizo” or a close phonetic approximation to be present; our expression matched “schizophrenia” its subtypes and various approximations: “schizo” “skitzo” “skitso” “schizotypal” “schizoid” etc. All data we collect are public posts made between 2008 and 2015 and exclude any message marked as ‘private’ by the author. All use of the data reported in this paper has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB). Each self-stated diagnosis included in this study was examined by a human annotator (one of the authors) to verify that it appeared to be a genuine statement of a schizophrenia diagnosis excluding jokes quotes or disingenuous statements. We obtained 174 users with an apparently genuine selfstated diagnosis of a schizophrenia-related condition. Note that we cannot be certain that the Twitter user was actually diagnosed with schizophrenia only that their statement of being diagnosed appears to be genuine. Previous work indicates that interannotator agreement for this task is good: κ = 0.77 (Coppersmith et al. 2014a). For each user we obtained a set of their public Twitter posts via the Twitter API collecting up to 3200 tweets.5 As we wish to focus on user-authored content we exclude from analysis all retweets and any tweets that contain a URL (which often contain text that the user did not author). We lowercase all words and convert any non-standard characters (including emoji) to a systematic ASCII representation via Unidecode.6 For our community controls we used randomlyselected Twitter users who primarily tweet in English. Specifically during a two week period in early 2014 each Twitter user who was included in Twitter’s 1% “spritzer” sample had an equal chance for inclusion in our pool of community controls. We then collected some of their historic tweets and assessed the language(s) they tweeted in according to the Chromium Compact Language Detector.7 Users were excluded from our community controls if their tweets were less than 75% English.8,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2700171.2791026,Detecting Changes in Suicide Content Manifested in Social Media Following Celebrity Suicides,Developing a Control Privacy Note,2,Next we develop a control to establish that changes in volume of posts in SW succeeding a celebrity suicide compared to that preceding it is attributed to the topic of suicide in particular and such changes are not part of a broader shift in interest in mental health topics. For this purpose we identified a set of “control group” subreddits which are on topics related to mental health but are unlikely to be specifically about suicide or suicidal ideation. These mental health subreddits (henceforth referred to as MH subreddits) were compiled based on our prior work in [11]; refer to the paper for details on how these subreddits are identified and crawled. Table 3 lists the control subreddits crawled in the same timeframe as SW. We obtained 32509 posts from 23807 unique users. Like SW all of these subreddits are public.,Privacy Note: All social media data used in this paper are publicly available. At no time did we contact or interact with a user. Given the sensitive nature of this research we took care to anonymize the data in analysis and presentation so as to minimize any inadvertent disclosure of personal information or information that may reveal cues about an individual’s online identity. Approval was obtained from the relevant institutional review boards.
https://aclanthology.org/W17-3110.pdf,Small but Mighty: Affective Micropatterns for Quantifying Mental Health from Social Media Language,Data,2,We briefly explain the data collection method here but we refer the interested reader with further questions on the methodology to Coppersmith et al. (2016) for the suicide attempt data and Coppersmith et al. (2014a) for all other conditions. The data for these analyses are Twitter posts collected via two methods. Most of the data come from users who have publicly discussed their mental health conditions. These users are frequently referred to as “self-stated diagnosis” users as they state publicly something like “I was diagnosed with schizophrenia” or “I’m so thankful to have survived my suicide attempt last year”. The data for users with a suicide attempt was supplemented by data from OurDataHelps.org a data donation site where people provide access to their public posts and fill out a short questionnaire about their mental health history. Data are then deidentified and made available to researchers addressing questions of interest to the mental health community. Donors provide consent for their data to be used in mental health research upon signup. Of the users who attempted suicide 146 came from OurDataHelps.org. Specifically we examine generalized anxiety disorder eating disorders panic attacks schizophrenia and attempted suicides. These conditions were selected based on the theory that there are important timing aspects to their symptoms – ebbing and flowing of symptoms as treatment is effective (especially schizophrenia) onset and exacerbation of symptoms by external events and stress and punctuated events in time of psychological symptoms (suicide attempts panic attacks and binging/purging behavior with eating disorders). We use the Twitter streaming API to collect a sample of users who used a series of mental health words or phrases in their tweet text (e.g. ‘schizophrenia‘ or ‘suicide attempt‘). Each tweet that uses one of these phrases is examined via regular expression to indicate that the user is talking about themselves. Finally those tweets that pass the regular expression are examined by a human to confirm (to the best of our ability) that their selfstatement of diagnosis appears to be genuine. This results in a dataset with users that have a self-stated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2408) an eating disorder (749) panic attacks (263) schizophrenia (350) or someone who would go on to attempt suicide (423). Some of these users do not exhibit the sort of posting behavior required to create micropatterns (i.e. they rarely post multiple times within a 3 hour time window). We exclude these users from our analysis which is 5-9% of users for most conditions with the exception of those with a suicide attempt where a little over half the users do not exhibit this posting behavior. The resultant dataset used for analyses is: generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2271) eating disorders (687) panic attacks (247) schizophrenia (318) suicide attempts (157). In order to allow comparisons of each condition to control users we gather a random sample of 10000 Twitter users for whom at least 75% of their posts are identified by Twitter as English. All the users with a self-stated diagnoses and all members of this control population have their age and gender estimated according to Sap et al. (2014). For each user with a self-stated diagnosis we find a matched control through the following procedure: create a pool of users where the estimated gender matches and the estimated age is within the same 10-year bracket (the suggested accuracy of the age estimator). From that pool of age- and gender- matched users we select the user whose tweets start and end over the most similar timeframe. We will refer to these age- gender- and time-matched controls simply as “matched controls” throughout the rest of this paper. All tweets were publicly posted by their author (i.e. no users marked at “protected” or “private” were included). On average users had 2949 tweets. The distribution of estimated age and genders for users with each self-stated condition can be seen in Figure 1. For most conditions the population skews female though for schizophrenia the genders are roughly balanced. The average age tends to be in the early-to-mid 20s.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2998181.2998220,Gender and Cross-Cultural Differences in Social Media Disclosures of Mental Illness,Privacy and Ethics Twitter Data,2,We leverage public data from Twitter and Reddit for our work; hence our work did not qualify for approval from our Institutional Review Board. Nevertheless we took greater care in de-identifying and paraphrasing any content we present as examples to support our investigation. Importantly our work does not make any diagnostic claims about mental illness experiences of the population we study.,Our study uses publicly shared mental illness self-disclosure data collected from the social media Twitter. We started by obtaining a large sample of English language candidate selfdisclosure posts from the full archive of public Twitter data around a variety of mental health concerns. Specifically we filtered the Twitter posts shared in March 2015 containing any of the keyphrases included in Table 1. These keyphrases were collated by a combination of reference to prior work [11 12] and consultation with a trained psychiatrist practitioner. Through these keyphrases we sought to identify who publicly state that they have been diagnosed with or suffering from some form of mental illness. As noted by Coppersmith et al. users may make such a statement to seek support from others in their Twitter social network to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps as an explanation of some of their behavior [11]. We obtained 1319064 posts from 534829 unique users at the end of this initial data collection phase. Parallelly we obtained a candidate control data sample from Twitter’s Firehose stream so as to allow robust statistical comparisons between Twitter users who choose to self-disclose their mental illness and those who do not. This dataset included a random sample of 1513279 posts from 673898 unique users made on Twitter during March 2015 ensuring that none of these posts matched any of the keyphrases given in Table 1. Thereafter for both of the candidate mental health disclosure sample and the candidate control sample of posts we utilized Twitter’s official API3 to obtain the last 3200 posts for each of the unique users in both datasets. For the control dataset if any of the users had any post in their crawled posts matching one of the keyphrases above we disregard them from our analysis. Further employing the Google Compact Language Detector4  we disregarded any users if at least 75% of their posts were not written in English. Our final candidate disclosure sample contained 51038914 posts from 470337 users (µ = 108.5) while the control sample contained 66214850 posts from 480685 users (µ = 137.7).
https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e14199/,Detecting Signs of Depression in Tweets in Spanish: Behavioral and Linguistic Analysis,Study Steps,1,This study was designed and developed in 2 steps with the aim of analyzing the linguistic patterns and behavioral features of Twitter users suffering from depression in comparison with the general population of Twitter users. The study was focused on tweets written in Spanish. In the first step the selection of users and the compilation of tweets were performed. Given the design and purpose of the study we decided to use the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) [41]. Using this API 3 datasets of tweets were created: The depressive users dataset was made up of the timeline of 90 users who publicly mentioned on their Twitter profile that they suffer from depression. The control dataset was made up of the timeline of 450 randomly selected Twitter users. The depressive tweets dataset was constituted by a manual selection of tweets from the depressive users dataset which specifically included expressions indicative of depression. In the second step comparison and analysis of the 3 datasets of tweets (control depressive users and depressive tweets datasets) were carried out to spot their distinguishing features. In the rest of this section we will describe the methodology in detail. The flow diagram of the study is depicted in Figure 1.,
https://aclanthology.org/W18-0608.pdf,Cross-cultural differences in language markers of depression online,Data Collection,0,Data was collected from 7 Cups of Tea an anonymous online chat-based peer support community for emotional distress1 . Users agree at signup that their data may be used for the purposes of research. All the data used for the current study was anonymous and securely stored. This research was performed in line with the ethical and privacy protocols outlined in detail in (Benton et al. 2017). Data from 7 Cups takes the form of written dialogue between users of the service and volunteers who are trained as “active listeners”. A fragment of an exchange between the user of the service (U) and the volunteer (V) might go as follows: For the analyses reported in this paper we used only text generated by users of the service not the volunteers providing peer support. Users who reported depression as their primary concern at sign up were eligible for inclusion in analyses. Our original sample was comprised of 23048 conversations involving 1937 unique users. Users were excluded from the sample if they did not indicate their culture or if they selected ‘Other’. This resulted in the exclusion of 199 and 130 users respectively. The original sample also included users identifying as Native American or American Indian. This group was excluded from analyses since the majority of the data among these users was not English. This resulted in the removal of 15 users leaving a total sample size of 1593.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359169,Cross-Cultural Differences in the Use of Online Mental Health Support Forums,Privacy Ethics and Disclosure Method of Analysis,0,All data analyzed in this study was sourced (with license and consent) from the Talklife and 7Cups platforms. Additionally to maintain user anonymity all personally identifiable information was removed from the dataset before any findings were reported. Additionally all work was approved by our institution’s Institutional Review Board.,"Selection Criteria and Data Scope. To understand the impact of cultural differences on how individuals use online mental health platforms we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of users from different national communities on Talklife a support platform with over half a million users [91]. For this analysis due to the fact that most research in CSCW on mental health online has been done either agnostic of cultural context [12 34] or in a Western context [60 67 88] we choose to focus on users from non-Western countries following Zhang et al. [103]. As researchers located in the Global South and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory models [52] of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of CSCW and CSCWadjacent mental health research away from the West is crucial to better meet the needs of people often underserved by the medical system [70]. To create these subgroups of users we choose the three non-Western countries with the highest user populations on Talklife or India Malaysia and the Philippines. Guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuances to mental health expression for each country [35 62 77 80] we examine the national identity linguistic and behavior-based differences of use between each user subgroup. In particular this research notes that as a result of cultural norms around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualizations of mental illness in India Malaysia and the Philippines symptoms are often expressed in somatic and religious terms as opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric terms. We choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reasons. On a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity has commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity [31 33 52]. Additionally on a more practical level each user’s country was determined using their IP address by Talklife and shared with us in an user-anonymized dataset. Inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity as discussed in past work [47] and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural differences than analysis at the national level. We analyze data from 10532 Indian users 3370 Malaysian users and 3370 Filipino users as shown in Table 2. Collectively we refer to these countries as the minority sample. As a comparison set we construct a random sample of all threads on Talklife and refer to it as the majority sample. Due to the relative prevalence of users from Western English-speaking countries in Talklife most of the threads in the majority sample include posts from countries such as the USA UK and Canada. Indians are the largest non-Western minority subgroup on Talklife. Data was sampled from May 2012 to June 2018. Following this cross-national analysis to see if our broader results on Talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest Western country (the United States) and the largest non-Western country (India) represented on 7Cups a similar support platform with more than 15000 users actively using the platform each week [7]. Using 7Cups data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural differences we found in our Talklife sample. For this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from 6055 Indian users and 18581 American users as shown in Table 2. Unlike our sample of Talklife users this dataset is not a random sample. There is an upsampling of Indian users to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of Indians in the dataset. Like on Talklife Indians are the largest non-Western minority subgroup on 7Cups. We focus on Indian users due to a lack of sufficient data on users from Malaysia or the Philippines. Data was sampled from March 2014 - August 2018. 3.1.2 Defining Cultural Identity and Use of Clinical Language. In this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forums. To do so we leverage Tomlinson’s definition of cultural identity as “self and communal definitions based around specific usually politically inflected differentiations: gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality"" [94] particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that runs along national lines as delineated by Hall et al. [41]. As a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other forms of identity including religious or ethnic identity. However in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity as a proxy for cultural identity. Additionally following Schlesinger et al’s [83] call for more intersectional analyses and methods within HCI we also include analyses of adjacent and intersecting identities when relevant including religious identity. To analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnoses. Following methods used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language [30] we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigrams and trigrams from a list of mental disorders as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [100]. We also included all unigrams from the MacMillan Dictionary list of words used to describe illnesses and diseases both specifically for mental illness and general illness [1–3]. As a result we include unigrams like “night"" (from night terrors) or sleep (from “sleep disorder"") as these are often correlated with specific symptoms of mental illness or distress such as sleep issues or being awake at night [30]. This included any clinically common abbreviations for mental disorders such as OCD for “obsessive compulsive disorder"" or BPD for “borderline personality disorder."" Shorthand for disorders commonly used by online communities such as “pro-ana” (as used in pro-eating disorder communities) [22] were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these terms across disorders. We choose to use terms from and associated with DSM and ICD categorized disorders as a result of the common usage of these frameworks globally [99]. Throughout our analysis of these varied factors we use µ to represent means and σ to represent standard deviations. 3.1.3 Constraints Limitations and Tradeoffs. Cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting levels including subcultures and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity. As a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraints in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis. One large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level as a proxy for cultural identity. Though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity as argued by both Hall [41] and Tomlinson [94] each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identities that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity [54 64 89]. A more rich analysis of these other forms of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusions about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support communities particularly with regard to cultural differences between users with the same national identity. Additionally to stay consistent between analyses as a result of a lack of data on users from Malaysia and the Philippines we only analyze users in India on 7Cups and extend these findings to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum. We draw validity for these exploratory findings from similar consistent patterns we observe between Indian Malaysian and Filipino users but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority communities these conclusions do not hold true. Additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used DSM and ICD both frameworks of illness categorization have significant limitations particularly in the countries we have selected. For example there are both mental health disorders that are culturebound [74] as well as mental health language that is used in different ways within the specific countries we analyze such as depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illnesses [53]. Additionally it is clear that online support communities often develop their own cultural norms and language around mental health [21 72] and a deeper understanding of how this plays out on Talklife and 7Cups is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work. In this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical terms for mental health disorders in our analysis of clinical language. As detailed in past anthropological research [52] it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across cultures as a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder as opposed to conceptualizing distress as “stress"" “tension"" or “depression"" [25 53 98]. For our analysis we strictly analyzed posts that were in the Latin alphabet with almost all posts on both Talklife and 7Cups being in English. However as both Malay [8] and Tagalog [82] are most commonly written in the Latin script and since it is common for users from India speakers to use romanized versions of Indian languages online [79] it is possible that a small minority of posts in our analysis were text in a different language. However as confirmed by only seeing English words used in our analysis of the top n-grams among each user subgroup it is clear that English is the predominant language on both platforms. Though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of non-English code-switching on these platforms could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interactions on expression between users with the same national identity but different language preferences."
https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2197-z,Automatic extraction of informal topics from online suicidal ideation,Discussion,1,To evaluate our models we first subjectively evaluated the latent topics represented by clusters of words. We then compared these topics to risk factors generated by domain experts. Our in-depth analysis revealed several key findings. First we found that the topics discovered by our analysis had a large scope. Topics ranged from crying to clothing to the calendar. This illustrates that our model was able to identify different latent topics within the corpus and separate them into meaningful clusters. It also shows that there are topics that people discuss which are not directly related to suicide as not every word is on the topic of suicide. When comparing our automatically generated topics to previously identified risk factors we found that there were some differences in the focus of the topics compared to that of the risk factors. In the case of “Drug Abuse” people tended to discuss recreational drugs specifically alcohol separately from medications and pills. This difference in focus shows how the public view of these two topics may fit under the umbrella term provided by experts but differ enough to be separate topics. On the other hand in the case of “Family Violence and Discord” and “Suicide Around Individual” the topics generated by our model seemed to indicate a broader topic rather than topics as specific as these risk factors. A result of collecting data from public users with presumably no professional medical experience is the difference in precision of language between users and medical professionals. An indicator of this difference is in discussing depression. While professionals made a difference between “Depressive Feelings” and “Depressive Symptoms” the topics identified from users’ posts overlapped these ideas. This may be partly due to the fact that depressive feelings are a symptom of depression but also to a lack in precise use of language to describe specific experiences and symptoms. Our contribution to this field is the discovery of latent topics within textual data known to contain suicidal ideation. A common method for identifying suicidal ideation in social media is to use a filter designed by medical professionals to extract data. Such a technique may impose a structure on the data by medical professionals that does not reflect the actual language used by those experiencing suicidal ideation. Our method uses topic modeling to uncover informal latent topics directly from social media posts which captures the ideas deemed important by those who are sharing their experiences with an online community. This information will inform the medical community which informal topics are important to monitor in informal contexts such as social media to effectively identify suicidal ideation.When comparing our automatically generated topics to previously identified risk factors we found that there were some differences in the focus of the topics compared to that of the risk factors.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8609647,Online Social Networks in Health Care: A Study of Mental Disorders on Reddit,Dataset,0,Reddit is a multilingual Online Social Network founded in 2005 and organized in subcommunities by areas of interest called subreddits. We obtained data from the Reddit's data repository4 focusing on four subreddits where people discuss issues related to mental heath disorders: Depression (/r/depression) Suicide Watch (/r/Suicide Watch) Anxiety (/r/anxiety) and Bipolar (/r/bipolar). Our dataset is comprised of user activities (posts and comments) that took place between 2011 and 201 7. Here we focus on data from January 2017 to December 2017. In total we obtained 261511 posts and 1256669 comments from 184708 unique users. Table I shows the total number of users posts and comments per subreddit. The total number of comments in each community is at least 4.2 times larger than the number of posts which suggests a supportive behavior among users.,
