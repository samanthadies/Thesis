Separate surveys were created for depressed and healthy individuals. In the depressed survey participants were invited to complete a survey that involved passing a series of inclusion criteria responding to a standardized clinical depression survey answering questions related to demographics and history of depression and sharing social media history. We used the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) questionnaire to screen participant depression levels []. CES-D assessment quality has been demonstrated as on-par with other depression inventories including the Beck Depression Inventory and the Kellner Symptom Questionnaire [ ]. Healthy participants were screened to ensure no history of depression and active Instagram use. See Additional file  for actual survey text. Qualified participants were asked to share their Instagram usernames and history. An app embedded in the survey allowed participants to securely log into their Instagram accounts and agree to share their data.b Upon securing consent we made a one-time collection of participants’ entire Instagram posting history. In total we collected  photographs from  Instagram users  of whom had a history of depression. We asked a different set of MTurk crowdworkers to rate the Instagram photographs collected. This new task asked participants to rate a random selection of  photos from the data we collected. Raters were asked to judge how interesting likable happy and sad each photo seemed on a continuous - scale. Each photo was rated by at least three different raters and ratings were averaged across raters. Raters were not informed that photos were from Instagram nor were they given any information about the study participants who provided the photos including mental health status. Each ratings category showed good inter-rater agreement. Only a subset of participant Instagram photos were rated (N = ). We limited ratings data to a subset because this task was time-consuming for crowdworkers and so proved a costly form of data collection. For the depressed sample ratings were only made for photos posted within a year in either direction of the date of first depression diagnosis. Within this subset for each user the nearest  posts prior to the diagnosis date were rated. For the control population the most recent  photos from each user’s date of participation in this study were rated.,Several different types of information were extracted from the collected Instagram data. We used total posts per user per day as a measure of user activity. We gauged community reaction by counting the number of comments and ‘likes’ each posted photograph received. Face detection software was used to determine whether or not a photograph contained a human face as well as count the total number of faces in each photo as a proxy measure for participants’ social activity levels. Pixel-level averages were computed for Hue Saturation and Value (HSV) three color properties commonly used in image analysis. Hue describes an image’s coloring on the light spectrum (ranging from red to blue/purple). Lower hue values indicate more red and higher hue values indicate more blue. Saturation refers to the vividness of an image. Low saturation makes an image appear grey and faded. Value refers to image brightness. Lower brightness scores indicate a darker image. See Figure  for a comparison of high and low HSV values. We also checked metadata to assess whether an Instagram-provided filter was applied to alter the appearance of a photograph. Collectively these measures served as the feature set in our primary model. For the separate model fit on ratings data we used only the four ratings categories (happy sad likable interesting) as predictors.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858207 ,Discovering Shifts to Suicidal Ideation from Mental Health Content in Social Media,Constructing User Classes,2,We split our data into two sequential time periods (t1 from Feb 11 2014 to Aug 11 2014 and t2 from Aug 12 2014 to November 11 2014). Using these two time periods we created two sets of users. Note that since Reddit does not enforce the real name rule of having exactly one account per person our reference to “users” in this paper is equivalent to “user accounts”. First we identified those users that posted on MHs during t1 but did not post on SW during t1 or t2 (i.e. users that discuss mental health topics but not on SW; hereafter “MH”). The second class included those who posted on MHs during t1 and posted in SW during t2 (i.e. users that discuss mental health topics originally not related to suicide but eventually transition to talk about suicide; hereafter “MH → SW”). Figure 1 shows a schematic description of our user class construction. Note that by focusing on users that initiate at least one post on SW or the MHs as opposed to only commenting we can focus on those frequenting the communities for support disregarding those primarily providing help through commentary. This split yielded 440 MH → SW users; which is 1.52% of the total number of 28831 accounts who posted in MHs but never on SW during either of the periods. To construct a MH cohort of equal size who did not post on SW in either period we randomly sampled a set of 440 users from the 28831 users. Note although MH users did not post on SW during our timeframe of analysis they may have done so outside the bounds of our analysis. To support our goal of characterizing differences between the MH → SW and MH users we obtained via Reddit’s API the timeline of posts and comments authored by the 880 users (the API only provides the last 1000 public posts and comments for a user). For each post we obtained their associated metadata (e.g. vote difference or score) and comments. Our final dataset contained 4731 posts and 46949 comments from the 440 MH → SW users and 8318 posts and 54086 comments from the 440 MH users. We note an important concern: individuals may post suicidal thoughts on MHs never engaging on SW and thus “corrupting” the MHs data with discussions of suicidal ideation. We argue against this possibility. (1) SW is a prominent suicide support forum and the role of this community in suicide prevention and in acting as an inoculator of vulnerable thoughts is well-recognized [31]. (2) Most MHs (e.g. r/depression) clearly specify in their guidelines that suicidal thoughts should go to SW: “It’s usually better to post anything that specifically involves suicidal thoughts or intent in /r/SuicideWatch rather than here. If you’re concerned about someone else who may be at risk for suicide please check out their talking tips and risk assessment guide.” (3) Finally discussions with the moderators of SW confirmed that active steps are taken to move all suicidal ideation related content to SW. Given these considerations we expect that few suicidal ideation posts appear on subreddits outside of SW.,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702613.2732733,Detecting and Characterizing Mental Health Related Self-Disclosure in Social Media,Data Collection Generating Ground Truth on Self-Disclosure,0,We used Reddit's official API to collect posts comments on posts and associated metadata from several mental health focused subreddits. We build on the data collection methodology we used in [4]. In order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized Reddit's native subreddit search feature (http://www.reddit.com/reddits). We searched for subreddits on “mental health”. Two researchers familiar with Reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search results returned so that we “seed” on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concerns. Thereafter we focused on a snowball approach to compile a second list of “related” or “similar” subreddits that are mentioned in the profile pages of the seed subreddits. Sample of subreddits (31 in all) we crawled are given in Table 1. Note all of these subreddits host public content. For the purposes of self-disclosure detection we also identified subreddits (sample listed in Table 2) as our control group (total of 12 subreddits) – meaning they are unrelated to mental health topics. For sanity check we randomly sampled a set of 200 posts from the control subreddits and two researchers familiar with Reddit manually checked their content for presence of any mental health content. We found that 97% of subreddit content in our sample were not about any mental health concern (Cohen’s Kappa for inter-rater agreement was .84). In all our dataset had 32509 posts from 23807 users in the mental health subreddits and 15383 posts from 13216 users in the control forums. For each of the unique users in the mental health forums we further collected all of their Reddit post/comment histories (last 1000 posts/comments per Reddit API limits) if their number of posts and comments in our dataset was five or more – this gave us 7248 users and 4.1M posts/comments,Automatic detection of self-disclosure levels in posts necessitates obtaining gold standard labels on self-disclosure in essence “ground truth”. For the purpose two raters familiar with Reddit and its mental health communities in particular independently rated a small random sample (50 posts) with equal proportions from mental health and control subreddits for three levels of self-disclosure – no selfdisclosure low and high self-disclosure. These three classes of self-disclosure were chosen based on categorization by Bak et al in [10]. The raters mutually discussed their labels thereafter and thus came up with a set of rules for rating. The rules were further aligned with observations in prior work [9 10 11]. Per the rules: Posts that either reveal personal information (e.g. age location gender etc.) or divulge sensitive or vulnerable thoughts beliefs or embarrassing/confessional experiences were to be considered to be indicative of high self-disclosure. Joinson [10] characterized sensitive disclosure in terms of the extent of “revealed vulnerability”. Posts about self but not disclosing any personal or emotionally vulnerable content was to be considered of low self-disclosure. No self-disclosure posts were those which were about people or things other than the posting author and which divulged information unrelated to the self. Following these mutually agreed upon rules the previous two raters and an additional rater familiar with Reddit independently coded a larger sample of 800 posts to create a training set for the purposes of classification. The raters had good agreement in their ratings: Fleiss’ Kappa was found to be .73. However given the subjective nature of characterization of self-disclosure we considered only those posts in the training set for which we had agreement across all three raters – this gave us 627 posts. Across the three categories the coded set consisted of 38% posts of high selfdisclosure 35% posts of low self-disclosure and 27% with no self-disclosure. Table 3 gives examples of mental health post excerpts with high self-disclosure while Table 4 and 5 provide examples of low and no self-disclosure posts. Note that including non-mental health posts in the training set was essential so as to let the detector learn on posts of low and no self-disclosure and on those not mental health related.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702280,Recognizing Depression from Twitter Activity,Data Gathering Features for Recognizing Depression,0,In this study we gathered information on depression levels of Twitter users and their activity histories. To do this we published a website to administer a questionnaire and disseminated information about the website over Twitter1. In contrast to De Choudhury et al. [14] who collected data from Englishspeaking users through crowdsourcing this study collected data from Japanese-speaking volunteers. This approach was used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research [14]. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of our website. The website collected the responses to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the Twitter users who participated (hereinafter the participants) and to collect the histories of participants activities on Twitter. The activity histories of participants were collected through the Twitter application programming interface (API)2 and the questionnaires to determine degree of depression were completed by participants through their web browsers. Before data collection visitors to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aims of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled. Those who consented to become participants after receiving the explanation logged into their individual Twitter accounts through the OAuth authorization process. Next participants were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression. A message called the “kokoro score” (“kokoro” is a Japanese word meaning “heart”) determined on the basis of answers to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweets was displayed to participants after completion of the questionnaire (Fig. 2). Experiment participants were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over Twitter by word-of-mouth in a type of snowball sampling. The CES-D questionnaire was used to evaluate the degree of depression [30]. In the CES-D test participants answered 20 questions on a Likert-type 4-point scale. Each answer was assigned a score of 0-3 points with the sum of the points from all answers used as the score to estimate likelihood of depression. Several standards exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression. In this research we regarded a score of 22 points or higher as indicating active depression and a score of 21 points or lower as indicating no active depression; these are the same values as used in [14] and give a cutoff score of 22. In addition answers to BDI [2] a depression scale used with characteristics similar to CESD were collected to ensure the reliability of data. For each participant scores were calculated on both scales with poor correlation regarded as indicating unreliable answers. The time taken to answer the questionnaires was also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded. After each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on Twitter was collected from Twitter by using the API. At most 3200 tweets were collected for each participant and the number of users following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded. Tweets published after the questionnaire was taken were discarded. The website was opened to the public on 4 December 2013 at which time the authors publicized it on their Twitter accounts. Between 4 December 2013 and 8 February 2014 219 people participated in the experiment. After eliminating participants who did not tweet and participants who answered the questionnaire in fewer than 30 seconds (as previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answers) 214 sets of answers remained. Only the first set of answers was used for participants who completed the questionnaire more than once. As a result data about 209 experiment participants (male: 121; female: 88) aged 16 to 55 (mean: 28.8 years; standard deviation: 8.2 years) were analyzed. The correlations between CES-D score and BDI score for these participants were high 0.87 and there were no participants with uncorrelated scores so the data for all 209 participants were used; excluded datasets are not discussed any further. Figure 3 shows the histogram of CES-D scores of 209 participants. Among the participants 81 (resp. 128) were estimated to have (resp. not have) active depression for an incidence of approximately 39%. This incidence is similar to that found by De Choudhury et al. [14] who identified depression in approximately 36% of participants. Table 1 gives statistics on the activity histories of participants.,It is possible to extract various features from the activity histories of Twitter users. This section explains what kinds of features are used to estimate degree of depression and the way in which these quantities are extracted. Table 2 shows the features used in this study. A detailed explanation of each feature follows. The frequencies of words in a tweet (i.e. its bag of words) are used as a basic feature relating to the content of the tweet. Tsugawa et al. showed that the word frequencies are useful for identifying depression [37]. MeCab [20] was used to for morphological stemming and categorization of the Japanese tweet text to obtain accurate word frequencies. Particles auxiliary verbs adnominal adjectives and visual symbols were excluded for extracting content words. Words used by only one participant were also excluded resulting in a total of 84255 distinct words. However most of these words were rarely used and the distribution of word frequencies is extremely biased (see Fig. 4). Because words with a low rate of use were regarded as unlikely to be associated with depression for most users the frequencies of only the 20000 words with the highest rate of use (corresponding to 25 or more uses across all participants) were used as a feature in this study. Furthermore because the number and length of tweets differed by participant the word frequencies were normalized by the total number of words in the tweets. The topics of the tweets of each user as estimated by using a representative topic model LDA [5] were used as a second feature relating to the content of the tweets. With LDA the distribution of topics in each document is estimated from the word frequencies in each text through unsupervised learning on the assumption that the text and the words in it are generated according to a particular topic [5]. In LDA the number of topics to identify and a set of documents (as bags of words) are used as input and a topic distribution is output for each document. As mentioned in Related Work Section the topics of essays written by university students were estimated by using LDA and found to be useful in evaluating degree of depression [31]. From that study topics are expected to be a useful feature. A set of all tweets of each user was used as the user document for input in LDA and the 20000 words selected as described above were used as the words. We used LDA with collapsed Gibbs sampling [16]. As the parameters of LDA we used α = 50/K and β = 0.1 where K is the number of topics [16]. All extracted topics were used as the features. The ratio of positive words and the ratio of negative words used in the tweet text are used as the final features relating to tweet content. Users with depression are intuitively expected to use negative words more frequently than users without depression do. To categorize words a dictionary of affective words [19] which is compiled by manual evaluation of a dictionary of positive and negative words extracted according to a technique proposed in the literature [35] is used. The dictionary contains 760 positive words and 862 negative words. The user’s timing of tweets frequency of tweets average number of words retweet rate (rate of republishing other users’ tweets) mention rate (rate of directly referencing at least one other user) ratio of tweets containing a uniform resource locator (URL) number of users being followed and number of users following are used as features independent of the content of the tweet. The relative ratios of tweets posted during each hour of the day were used to characterize the timing of tweets; the number of posts per day was used as the posting frequency; and the ratio of qualifying tweets to all tweets were used for the retweet ratio mention ratio and ratio of tweets containing a URL. These features are used in prior research [14].,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12961-9,Forecasting the onset and course of mental illness with Twitter data,Feature Extraction Units of Observation,1,We extracted several categories of predictors from the Twitter posts collected. Predictor selection for both depression and PTSD was based on prior machine learning models of depression in Twitter data78 as the two conditions’ high comorbidity rates suggest their predictive signals may exhibit considerable overlap20. Depressed Twitter users have been observed to tweet less frequently than non-depressed users8 so we used total tweets per user per day as a measure of user activity. Tweet metadata was analyzed to assess average word count per tweet (here a word is defined as a set of characters surrounded by whitespace) whether or not the tweet was a retweet and whether or not the tweet was a reply to someone else’s tweet. The labMT LIWC 2007 and ANEW unigram sentiment instruments were used to quantify the happiness of tweet language37383940. The use of labMT which has shown strong prior performance in analyzing happiness on Twitter4142 is novel with respect to depression screening; ANEW and LIWC have been successfully applied in previous studies on depression and Twitter7814. LIWC was also used to compile frequency counts of various parts of speech (e.g. pronouns verbs adjectives) and semantic categories (e.g. food words familial terms profanity) as additional predictors37.,Determining the best time span for analysis raises a difficult question: When and for how long does mental illness occur? Receiving a clinical diagnosis of depression or PTSD does not imply that an individual remains in a persistent state of illness and so to conduct analysis with an individual’s entire posting history as a single unit of observation is a dubious proposition. At the other extreme to take one tweet as a unit of observation runs the risk of being too granular. De Choudhury et al.8 looked at all of a given user’s tweets in a single day and aggregated those data into per-person per-day units of observation. In this report we have followed the convention of aggregated “user-days” as a primary unit of analysis rather than try to categorize a person’s entire history or analyze each individual tweet. In our own previous research however we have found that many Twitter users do not generate enough daily content to make for robust unigram sentiment analysis43. For completeness we conducted analyses using both daily and weekly units of observation. Both analyses yielded predictive models of similar strengths with the weekly model showing a slight but consistent edge in performance. We report accuracy metrics from both analyses but restrict other results to the daily-unit analysis to allow for more direct comparison with previous research. Details of weekly-unit analytical results are available in Supplementary Information section II. When reporting results we occasionally refer to observations or tweets as “depressed” e.g. “depressed tweets received fewer likes”. It would be more correct to use the phrase “tweet data from depressed participants aggregated by user-days” instead of “depressed tweets” but we chose to sacrifice a degree of technical correctness for the sake of clarity.,
https://aclanthology.org/W14-3214.pdf,Towards Assessing Changes in Degree of Depression through Facebook,Dataset Degree of Depression,0,We used a dataset of 28749 nonclinical users who opted into a Facebook application (“MyPersonality”; Kosinski and Stillwell 2012) between June 2009 and March 2011 completed a 100-item personality questionnaire (an International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) proxy to the NEO-PI-R (Goldberg 1999) and shared access to their status updates containing at least 500 words. Users wrote on average of 4236 words (69917624 total word instances) and a subset of 16507 users provided gender and age in which 57.0% were female and the mean age was 24.8. The dataset was divided into training and testing samples. In particular the testing sample consisted of a random set of 1000 users who wrote at least 1000 words and completed the personality measure while the training set contained the 27749 remaining users.,We estimated user-level degree of depression (DDep) as the average response to seven depression facet items which are nested within the larger Neuroticism item pool. For each item users indicated how accurately short phrases described themselves (e.g. “often feel blue” “dislike myself”; responses ranged from 1 = very inaccurate to 5 = very accurate). Figure 1a shows the distribution of surveyassessed DDep (standardized). The items can be seen in Table 1. Figure 2 shows the daily averages of surveyassessed DDep collapsed across years. A LOESS smoother over the daily averages illustrates a seasonal trend with depression rising over the winter months and dropping during the summer.,
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6784326,Affective and Content Analysis of Online Depression Communities,Data Sets Feature Extraction,0,a) CLINICAL Communities: Communities who are interested in ‘depression’ and with at least 200 posts are extracted from LiveJournal. This is identified through the ‘Search communities by interest’2 provided by LiveJournal and results in 24 communities with 38401 posts. The CLINICAL communities are grouped based on name and description of the individual community: depression bipolar self-harm attachment/separation and suicide (See Table 1 for statistics). The earliest community creation date was in 2001 thus our data set spans over 10 years. b) CONTROL communities: We constructed a CONTROL data set using five popular categories of communities in the LiveJournal Directory.3 We select communities who have at least 200 posts resulting in 23 communities with 229563 posts. This set is called CONTROL and the statistics of these 23 communities and their description are shown in Table 2.,To characterize the difference between CLINICAL and CONTROL communities a variety of features are extracted: Affective features: We use the lexicon—Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) [5]—to extract the sentiment conveyed in the content. This lexicon consists of 1034 words rated in terms of valence and arousal and is thus suitable for a quantitative estimation. The valence of ANEW words is on a scale of 1 (very unpleasant) to 9 (very pleasant). The arousal is measured on the same scale—1 (least active) to 9 (most active). A cloud visualization of ANEW words used in the blog posts made by CLINICAL and CONTROL groups is illustrated in Fig. 1. Mood tags: LiveJournal provides a mechanism for users to tag their posts from a list of 132 pre-defined mood labels.4 Thus in addition to the emotion expressed in the text of posts the mood tag produced allows us direct access to the user sentiment. A cloud visualization of moods tagged on blog posts made by CLINICAL and CONTROL communities is llustrated in Fig. 2. LIWC features: We examine the proportions of words in psycholinguistic categories as defined in the LIWC package [27]: linguistic social affective cognitive perceptual biological relativity personal concerns and spoken.5 Table 3 presents the mean of these LIWC psycholinguistic processes for the CLINICAL and CONTROL communities. Whilst similar in the use words with positive emotion people in the CLINICAL communities tend to use words with more negative emotion—as examples anxiety anger and sadness. Further they discuss more issues about health and death in comparison with the CONTROL group. On the other hand the users in the CONTROL group discuss more neutral life related topics—ingestion home and leisure words. Topics: For extracting topics latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [4] is used as a Bayesian probabilistic modelling framework. LDA extracts the probabilities —that is words in a topic and then assigns a topic to each word in a document. For the inference part we implemented Gibbs inference detailed in [10]. We set the number of topics to 50 run the Gibbs for 5000 samples and use the last Gibbs sample to interpret the results.,
https://www.jmir.org/2017/7/e243/,Assessing Suicide Risk and Emotional Distress in Chinese Social Media: A Text Mining and Machine Learning Study,Data Collection,1,A Web-based survey of Weibo users was conducted to assess the respondents’ suicide risk and emotional distress (ie depression anxiety and stress). The invitation letter to participate in this survey was widely sent out to general Weibo users by various promotion activities. For a Weibo user to be eligible for the study she or he had to be 18 years or older (by self-report). A 30 Renminbi incentive for each complete survey was provided to boost the respond rate. With the respondents’ consent their Weibo posts that were posted in the public domain during the 12 months before the survey were downloaded by calling Weibo API. The survey fulfilled the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) checklist and details of the procedure have been reported in previous publications [2232]. In addition when multiple survey feedback were submitted from the same Internet protocol addresses only the first submission was used to avoid duplicate participation. In contrast to a previous study [32] this study excluded those who posted nothing throughout the 12 months but not those who posted fewer than 100 posts. Eventually data provided by 974 respondents remained for further analyses. The study has obtained ethical approvals from the Human Research Ethical Review Committee at the University of Hong Kong and the Institute Review Board of the Institute of Psychology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The survey measured respondents’ suicide probability score depression anxiety stress and Weibo suicide communication (WSC) as the outcome variables. In addition the respondents’ Weibo posts language features were extracted as independent variables or features for machine learning. The details of how those data were obtained are elaborated in the following subsections.,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,A Social Media Based Index of Mental Well-Being in College Campuses,Data Correcting from Under-Adoption of Reddit Demographic Representativeness,2,We first obtained a list of 150 ranked major universities in the United States by crawling the US News and World Report website [48]. This list is constructed based on the Carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researchers and using a set of 16 indicators of academic excellence defined by US News. The list includes a variety of universities spread across the US in different settings (e.g. urban rural) and with a wide range of student enrollment sizes. Figure 1(a) shows their geographic distribution. As a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata: gender distribution of students average tuition and fees and academic calendar (semester/quarter). To obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the Wikipedia pages of all of the 150 universities. From these pages we extracted the size of student enrollment type (public/private) and setting (rural/suburban/urban/city) at every institution. These definitions come from a formal categorization scheme used by the US Department of Education. The student body enrollment sizes ranged from 2255 to 97494 with 98 public and 52 private universities. 50 universities were reported to be urban 47 city 39 suburban and 13 rural. Finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the universities from a website known as Priceonomics [58]. The website calculates the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) by combining the race/ethnicity distribution of student bodies at different universities with data given from the Department of Education. HHI ranges from 1 (the least diverse: a population of all one type) to 1/N (the most diverse) where N is the number of different racial categories being analyzed. Social Media Data of Universities Next we obtained social media data of the above universities. Specifically we focused on the social media Reddit. Why Reddit? Reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social media site among the college student demographic [23]. Due to its forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing as well as for obtaining feedback and information from communities of interest. Reddit harbors a variety of communities known as “subreddits” including many dedicated to specific university campuses. This allows a large sample of posts shared by students of a university to be collected in one place. Our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits (e.g. r/gatech or r/KState) revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by students to discuss college topics (Table 1). Focusing on these public Reddit communities also does not require explicit data collection efforts to be coordinated at each of the 150 university sites. Although more students are likely to use Facebook due to its largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university’s students. Next while Twitter is also widely adopted without explicit self-reported information it is challenging to identify college student accounts. Finally prior work [2 18] notes that semianonymity of Reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topics like mental health. Initial Data Acquisition. We leveraged the archive of all of Reddit data made available on Google’s BigQuery [11]. BigQuery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third parties to access large publicly available dataset through simple SQL-type queries. Our queries grabbed all posts ranging between June 2011 and February 2016 available in the Reddit data archive. This included 424984 posts from 153378 unique users across all of the 146 universities with a mean of 2910.8 posts ( = 4329.6) and 1050 unique users ( = 1407) per subreddit. Filling the Gaps in Subreddit Data. The second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection. Through Reddit’s official API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) we obtained the most recent number of subscribers in the 146 university subreddits (as of July 2016). Then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data as given in step 1 we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit. This allows us to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative. For subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median (.42) (73 in all) we performed a one-time data collection using the Reddit API. This gave us a set of (at most) 1000 most recent posts for each subreddit with a total of 39824 posts added to the data obtained in step 1 following de-duplication. We note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distributions of data across the subreddits: The skew (yearly rate of change) before and after data filling were 4.86 and 5.05 respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a two-sample equivalence test (p = .013 p = .025) a test that uses two one-sided t-tests on the before-after yearly rates of change from both sides of a chosen difference interval [1 1].,Based on the Reddit data we collected from Figure 1(b) we observe high positive correlation between a university’s size of student body (enrollment) and the number of users subscribing to the corresponding subreddit (R2 = .38; ⇢2 = .6; p<.05). For subreddits deviating from trend it would imply that the associated university’s student body was under or overrepresented on Reddit. We therefore devised a method to identify these subreddits to correct especially for underadoption bias. We first calculated the ratio between the number of subreddit subscribers to student enrollment for each subreddit and the corresponding university. If for a subreddit this ratio was less than the expected adoption of Reddit for the same demographic group (4-8% as of 20161) we assumed that Reddit was under-adopted by the students in the corresponding university. We thus removed subreddits where this ratio was <4%. This brought down our subreddits from 146 to 109. In these 109 subreddits the mean Reddit adoption was 8.6% ( =1.3) which is close to the highest adoption reported by Pew. The final dataset employed in our ensuing analyses included 446897 posts from 152834 unique users (mean posts per subreddit: 4100; mean users per subreddit: 1402). Figure 2(a) gives a distribution of the volume of crawled posts over the years. Figure 2(b) gives the final distribution of subreddits over the unique user to subscriber count ratio. Figure 2(c-d) gives distribution of the posts and unique users across the final 109 subreddits.,We note it is possible that the type of students who frequent the university subreddits could be consistently different from the student body at the same university. To examine the representativeness of our university subreddit data we employed a random sample of 500 posts distributed across the subreddits and the years for manual examination of demographics. Two researchers then independently coded these posts for self-reported gender race or academic stage (undergraduate/graduate). For instance from the post “I’m a junior transfer and this will be my second semester” the researchers identified the post author to be an undergraduate whereas from “Hi all! I’m a new grad student (male 22) here the gender of the author can be inferred to be male. We found the interrater agreement to be high: Cohen’s  = .84. The relative ratios between the gender race and academic stage distributions of the coded posts and the university student body (obtained based on our methodology in the subsection “University Data”) showed significant positive correlation: The mean undergrad/grad ratio in our labeled data was 2.9 while it was 2.6 in the universities. A two-sample test of equivalence gave p-values of .016 and .011 respectively with respect to the difference interval [.4 .4]. The sex (male/female) ratio for our labeled data was 1.6 also observed to be statistically equivalent to that of the student body 1.1 (p = .02 p = .03 w.r.t. the difference interval [.5 .5]). This establishes the validity of our acquired Reddit data as a representative data source for studying mental health disclosures in university campuses.
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7752434,MIDAS: Mental illness detection and analysis via social media,Data Collection Feature Extraction,0,To train our models we require information from two different types of users: patients and non-patients. Therefore we employed a combined - manual effort and keyword matching - data collection approach to efficiently collect data for these users. For the collection of patients we manually collect the community portals relevant to both mental disorders. 2 From these portals' followers list we select the self-reported users who explicitly state in their profile description that they suffer from a mental illness; i.e. for a given user we are checking if his/her profile contains any keyword related to a target disorder (e.g. “borderline” “bpd” “bipolar”). Non-patients are referred to as random active Twitter users who are not explicitly stating that they are suffering from Bipolar disorder (hereinafter referred to as “BD”) or Borderline Personality Disorder (hereinafter referred to as “BPD”). To obtain these users we randomly sampled Twitter IDs. Thereafter we proceeded to download the tweets from the selected IDs. After the users have been identified we manually label them into one of two categories: 1) Patient: a person who is suffering from a mental disorder 2) Not-related: any user who we don't consider to be a patient. Lastly after having obtained the final list of patients we retrieve their tweets. These steps are applied for the collection of both BPD and BD patient datasets.,In this work we are focused on two main type of features (linguistic and behavioral). TF-IDF is adopted to model the linguist features of patients and Pattern of Life Features (PLF) adopted from the work of Coppersmith et al. [1] is used to model the behavioral style of patients. TF-IDF Features To capture the frequent and representative words used by the patients TF-IDF is applied on the unigram and bigrams collected from all the patients' tweets. Pattern of Life Features (PLF) These features reveal the emotional patterns and behavioral tendency of users by measuring polarity emotion and social interactions. In order to fully compose the PLF we combined the following list of features: Age and Gender: Twitter does not publicly provide information about the age and gender of its users mainly due to privacy concerns so we adopted the work of Sap et al. [5] to fill in this information. Polarity Features: The Sentiment140 API 3 was used to label each tweet as either positive negative or neutral. The polarity is furthermore transformed into five different values to capture the affective traits of each user: 1) Positive Ratio: the percentage of positive tweets 2) Negative Ratio: the percentage of negative tweets 3) Positive Combo: captures the mania and hypomania traits of patients which is determined by the number of continuous positive posts appearing more than x amount of times within a period of time in minutes T. 4) Negative Combos: captures the depression traits of patients and is determined by the number of continuous negative posts appearing more than x amount of times within a period of time in minutes T. 5) Flips Ratio: quantifies the emotional unstableness and is determined by counting how frequently two continuous tweets with different polarity (either positive to negative or negative to positive) appear together within a period of time in minutes T. In our work x is set to 2 and T is set to 30 minutes. Social Features: These features can demonstrate how users are behaving with respect to their environment. The following are the social features designed for each user: 1) Tweeting Frequency; the frequency of daily posts; 2) Mention Ratio: the percentage of posts which contain at least one mention of another user; 3) Frequent Mentions: the number of Twitter users mentioned more than three times which is a measurement of how many close friends a particular user may have; 4) Unique Mentions: the number of unique users mentioned which is a measure of the width of a user's social network.,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,A deep learning model for detecting mental illness from user content on social media,Classification Models,2,We developed six binary classification models each of which categorizes a user’ specific post into one of the following subreddits: r/depression r/Anxiety r/bipolar r/BPD r/schizophrenia and r/autism. Our conjecture is that a user who suffers from a specific mental problem writes a post on the corresponding subreddit that deals with the problem. A user can write posts across multiple subreddits if he/she suffers from multiple mental health problems e.g. a user suffering from both depression and anxiety. However if the model is trained with the posts of users who have multiple symptoms like a prior study10 the classification model may suffer from noisy data. Therefore we developed six independent binary classification models for each symptom to improve the performance. By developing six independent models for each mental disorder each of which uses data where users suffer from only one particular mental problem we were able to accurately identify a user’s potential mental state. For example to develop a model for detecting depression we labeled the posts written by users who upload posts only in the r/depression as the depression class; the opposite class is referred to as the non-depression class. To address a class-imbalance issue for the collected data we applied the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm19. We divided our dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Then XGBoost and convolutional neural network (CNN) were employed. Morover we excluded the posts of users who wrote posts across multiple subreddits in learning phase. To quantitatively represent each post we converted the words in the training set to numerical representations (Fig. 2). For the XGBoost classifier we used the TF-IDF vectorizer in the sckit-learn package20 to convert words into n-dimensional vectors. In the case of the CNN classifier we applied word-embedding procedures from the pre-processed texts using the word2vec API of Python Package Gensim21. The word vectors were pre-trained with the training dataset collected for the current study with continuous bag-of-words representation (CBOW) models while the size of window was set to five. Note that by using the pre-trained word2vec model for representing each post for each subreddit a language style used by users who write posts in a subreddit can be trained for the specific subreddit. An overview of the proposed CNN-based model is presented in Fig. 2. The model architecture is organized by the sequence of layers that includes an embedding layer convolutional layer max-pooling layer dense layers and the output. Fig. 2 illustrates how a post is trained in the given model. The first layer of the model is an embedding layer that represents the word embeddings of a pre-processed post with 20 dimensions and its weight is initialized by the pre-trained word2vec. Second a convolutional layer with input of word vectors has 128 filters and each filter size is five. In addition we applied a dropout rate of 0.25 to prevent over-fitting issues. The next layer is a max-pooling layer which takes the maximum values within the CNN filters and its dimension is 128. The output of the max-pooling layer is passed through two fully connected (dense) layers and the final output is the probability of the classification through the sigmoid activation function which ranges from 0 to 1. For training the neural network we used both the binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer22 with a learning rate of 0.001. Our model was trained through 50 epochs and the batch size was set to 64.,,
https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,Mental Health Surveillance over Social Media with Digital Cohorts,Mental Health Cohorts Analysis,2,We build on prior work on supervised models for mental health inference over social media data. We focus on two mental health conditions — depression and PTSD — and develop classifiers with the self-reported datasets created for CLPysch 2015 (Mitchell et al. 2015; Coppersmith et al. 2015b). These labeled datasets derive from users that have publicly disclosed on Twitter a diagnosis of depression (327 users) or PTSD (246 users) with an equal number of randomly selected demographically-matched (with respect to age and gender) users as controls. For each user the associated metadata and posting history was also collected — up to the 3000 most recent tweets per limitations of the Twitter API. The participants of the task proposed a host of methods ranging from rule-based systems to various supervised models (Pedersen 2015; PreotiucPietro et al. 2015; Coppersmith et al. 2015b). More recently the neural user-level classifier proposed by Amir et al. (2017) showed not only good performance on this task but also the ability to capture implicit similarities between users affected by the same diseases thus opening the door to more interpretable analyses2 . Hence we adopt their model for this analysis.,We constructed a cohort for our analysis by randomly selecting a sample of Twitter users and processing it with the aforementioned demographic inference pipeline. After discarding accounts from users located outside the United States we obtained a cohort of 48K Twitter users with the demographic composition shown in Figure 1. Some demographic groups are over-represented (e.g. young adults) while others are grossly underrepresented (e.g. teenagers) which illustrates the need for methodologies that can take these disparities into account. We then processed the cohort through the mental-health classifiers to estimate the prevalence of depression and PTSD and examine how these illnesses manifest across the population. The analysis revealed that 30.2% of the cohort members are likely to suffer from depression 30.8% from PTSD and 20% from both. We observe a significant overlap between people affected by depression and PTSD which is not surprising given that the comorbidity of these disorders is wellknown with approximately half of people with PTSD also having a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (Flory and Yehuda 2015). How do these conditions affect different parts of the population? To answer this question we looked at the affected users and measured how the demographics of individual sub-populations differ from those of the cohort as a whole. Figures 2 and 3 show the estimates for depression PTSD and both controlled for the cohort demographics. We observe large generational differences — PTSD seems to be more prevalent among older people whereas depression affects predominantly younger people. We also observe that in all cases Women are more susceptible than Men and Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be affected than Whites. This may represent a bias in the underlying data used to construct the classifiers or a difference in how social media is used by different demographic groups. For example models that were trained with a majority of data from White users maybe oversensitive to specific dialects used by other communities.,
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67186-4_6,Social Media Mining to Understand Public Mental Health,Data Methodology,0,We analyze two datasets: (1) user communities on Reddit and (2) journals from a mental health journalling mobile app. We omit the name of the app for privacy and we refer to it as the “journalling app”. Reddit is a social media platform that was originally used for sharing and rating content such as news documentaries and music. Users post in and subscribe to self-organized communities known as subreddits; subscribing to a subreddit allows a user to view all posts from that subreddit. An advantage of analyzing Reddit data is that the subreddits are labelled according to their topics. Utilizing curated lists from volunteer Reddit users we crawled all subreddits related to mental health as well as all subreddits linked by these communities. The second dataset consists of anonymized journal posts from a mobile app designed to help people track their moods and share them anonymously if they desire. For each journal post the app requires the user to label the journal post with at least one mood selected from a pre-populated list including “happy” “sad” etc. We obtained all journals and the associated moods written between January 2016 and January 2017. This amounts to over 1.2 million journals written by approximately 75000 users. Figure 1 plots the number of journals posted over time. Most of the journals were written in the first half of 2016 although we inspected topic distributions per month and did not find seasonal effects. Towards the beginning of 2016 many new users registered on the app and eventually stopped using it. Like weight-loss and productivity apps we believe this influx is tied to users looking to improve their habits as a New Year’s resolution. Each journal can be set to be private or public (visible to all other users of the app). Roughly one third of all journals are public. Figure 2 plots the number of users on the y-axis versus the percentage of journals they posted publicly. Most users are either mostly private or mostly public. Most journals are relatively short just like Twitter posts that are at most 140 characters. The average length of a journal with text in it is 128 characters; there are roughly 100000 journal that have no text only a mood label. We observed that private users tend to write journals that are slightly but statistically significantly longer than those written by public users by approximately 10 characters. Figure 3 shows the distribution of journal lengths where the spikes correspond to 0 length (mood only) 200 characters (the default limit set by the app) and 300 characters (set as the maximum for visualization purposes). Users of the app can optionally enter their location age and gender. While most users did not enter this information we found that those who revealed their location are mostly from North America those who revealed their gender are predominantly female and those who revealed their age have an average age of 25.,The goal of this analysis is to understand public mental health by mining social media. We want to identify common topics discussed publicly (Reddit plus public journals from the journalling app) and privately (private journals). For the Reddit dataset we simply count the number of subscribers in each subreddit related to mental health to discover popular topics and issues. Recall that each subreddit is labelled with its topic so topic modelling is not necessary. On the other hand for the journalling app each journal post is labelled with a mood but not with a topic. Below we describe our methodology for assigning topics to journals.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557214,Seeking and sharing health information online: comparing search engines and social media,Data on Health Conditions,1,A key challenge of this research was to identify the different health conditions on which people seek and share information via search engines and Twitter respectively. We identified four broad categories of conditions based on their severity and types: (1) symptoms of major diseases (2) benign explanations (non-life-threatening illnesses) (3) serious illnesses and (4) disabilities. We also characterized each condition by the degree of perceived social stigma provided by third-party judges. Our final list contained 165 conditions.,,
https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/viewPaper/8075,Mental Health Discourse on reddit: Self-Disclosure Social Support and Anonymity,Data and Methods,0,reddit is a social news website where registered users submit content in the form of links or text posts. Users also known as “redditors” can then vote each submission “up” or “down” to rank the post and determine its position or prominence on the site’s pages. These two attributes associated with a post are referred to as “upvotes” and “downvotes”. Redditors can also comment on posts and respond back in a conversation tree of comments. Content entries that is the posts are organized by areas of interest or sub-communities called “subreddits” such as politics programming or science. As of 2013 reddit’s official statistics included 56 billion page views 731 million unique visitors 40855032 posts and 404603286 comments (http://blog.reddit.com/2013/ 12/top-posts-of-2013-stats-and-snoo-years.html). We used of reddit’s official API (http://www.reddit.com/ dev /api) to collect posts comments and associated metadata from several mental health subreddits: specifically using a Python wrapper PRAW (https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/ latest/index.html). The subreddits we crawled were: alcoholism anxiety bipolarreddit depression mentalhealth MMFB (Make Me Feel Better) socialanxiety SuicideWatch. All of these subreddits host public content. In order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized reddit’s native subreddit search feature (http://www.reddit.com/reddits) and searched for subreddits on “mental health”. Two researchers familiar with reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search results returned so that we focus on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concerns and issues. Thereafter we focused on a snowball approach in which starting with a few seed subreddits (mentalhealth depression) we compiled a second list of “related” or “similar” subreddits that are listed in the profile pages of the seed subreddits. Following a second filtering step we arrived at the list of subreddits listed above. For each of these subreddits we obtained daily crawls of their posts in the New category. Corresponding to each post we collected information on the title of the post the body or textual content id timestamp when the post was made author id and the number of upvotes and downvotes it obtained. Since posts gather comments over a period of time following the time of sharing we crawled all of the comments per post that were shared over a three day period after the post was made. Qualitative examinations of the subreddits of interest revealed that 90% or more of the comments to any post were typically made in a three day window following the time the post is made—hence the choice. The crawl of the subreddits used in this paper We present some descriptive statistics of our crawled data. Our dataset contained 20411 posts with at least one comment and 97661 comments in all with 27102 unique users who made posts comments or both. A set of 7823 users (28.79%) were found to write both at least one post and comment. CDF of the user distribution over posts and comments is given in Figure 1. The figure shows the expected heavy tail trend observed in several social phenomena. Also see Figure 2 for the distribution of comments over time following post share. It illustrates the quick responsivity culture in the communities we study (peak at 3 hours). Some of the additional statistics of our dataset are given in Table 1. Further example titles of a few,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025932,Modeling and Understanding Visual Attributes of Mental Health Disclosures in Social Media,Limitations and Future Work,2,We acknowledge that there are some limitations to our work as the analysis and the inferences obtained are purely data driven and relied on public posts shared on Instagram around mental health challenges. Specifically to obtain disclosures of mental health issues we utilized tags attached to posts. We presume self-selection biases in users who make public posts and link them to different mental health hashtags. We caution against applying our methods to arbitrary contexts. Moreover although users might be voluntarily relating themselves to one of the mental health disorder categories it is unclear to what extent this constitutes an online identity construction activity. Importantly it is challenging to assess the gravity of a given user’s health condition using these posts or images alone or more specifically if they are actually experiencing a clinical mental health concern. On a related note although the tags we employed for obtaining our mental health data were verified through consultation with a licensed psychiatrist we do not claim our methods reveal symptoms or diagnostic markers of mental illness in individuals. Therefore the methods we developed in this paper were not evaluated for their effectiveness in discovering mental health concerns but rather as a principled and quantifiable way to understand the nature of mental health disclosures shared on social media. Putting it together our findings should not be interpreted to be diagnostic claims about one’s mental health. To do so we advocate for collaboration between clinicians and HCI researchers along with voluntarily consenting patients. This constitutes one of our future research directions. Finally qualitative methods would lend a deeper understanding of the motivations behind appropriating a public social media outlet for vulnerable and sensitive exchange. We also emphasize that the analyzed visual and linguistic patterns on Instagram are not the only patterns that can help study selfdisclosure. Indeed current advancements in machine learning approaches like deep learning [36] have created a new thread of research in image classification where image classification problems once difficult to solve can now be solved very efficiently. We believe such methods can be incorporated to study mental health imagery shared on social media,,
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300996,A content analysis of depression-related tweets,Tweets Related to Depression Themes Demographic Distributions,0,Tweets about depression were collected by Simply Measured a company that specializes in social media measurement and analytics (Simply Measured 2014). Simply Measured has access to the Twitter “firehose” (or full volume of tweets) via Gnip a licensed company that can retrieve the full Twitter data stream. All tweets in the English language that contained at least either “depressed” “#depressed” “depression” or “#depression” were collected between April 11 and May 4 2014. We scanned a random sample of the tweets to identify common phrases that included our keywords of interest but were not about mental health. In SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC) we used the index function which searches a character expression (in this case the text of the tweet) for a specific string of characters to locate and remove such tweets from our sample. We removed tweets that included the following terms regardless of capitalization: “Great Depression” “economic depression” “during the depression” “depression era” “tropical depression” and “depressed real estate”. The popularity and influence of the Tweeters was described using the distribution of followers and Klout Scores. While number of followers is a measure of popularity Klout Score is a measure of influence. Klout Scores range from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating higher influence. Klout Score is calculated based on an algorithm that considers over 400 signals from eight different online networks. Examples of signals include the amount of retweets a person generates in relation to the amount of tweets shared and the amount of engagement a user drives from unique individuals (e.g. lots of retweets from different individuals as opposed to lots of retweets from one person) (Klout Inc. 2014).,Using the SAS surveyselect procedure we selected a simple random sample of 2000 tweets (that were not direct @replies) from the total volume of depression-related tweets. Two members of the research team each with graduate level degrees (i.e. Ph.D. and M.P.H) and more than 10 years of experience in mental health research scanned approximately 300 random tweets in order to determine their most common themes and generate a codebook. We defined themes as topics that occur and reoccur (Ryan & Bernard 2003). Tweets were coded for presence of the following themes: 1) Tweeter discloses feelings of depression; 2) Tweet is a supportive or helpful message about depression; 3) Tweeter discloses feeling school or work-related pressures related to depression; 4) Tweeter engages in substance use to deal with depression; and 5) Tweeter discloses self-harm or suicidal thoughts. Tweets could be assigned as many themes as were pertinent. For tweets where the user indicated that he or she was feeling depressed those that appeared trivial (i.e. not concerning) were identified. These were tweets where the depression terms were used casually or in a humorous manner or referenced depression caused by trivial things such as being depressed after finishing a good book seeing a concert or watching a sad movie. In addition we ascertained the source of the tweet by viewing the Tweeter's profile picture and studying their Twitter handle name. The source was then coded into one of the three following categories: clinician/therapist health-focused handle (e.g. health/government organization handle focused on healthy lifestyle etc.) or regular person or other (handle did not fall into the above categories). Using this codebook the 2000 randomly sampled tweets were coded in teams of two trained student research interns who coded the tweets together discussing each tweet and coming to an agreement on the final assigned codes. A sample of 150 tweets was also coded by a senior team member (Ph.D. clinician) with extensive mental health research experience. Inter-coder reliability for each theme was as follows: 1) Tweeter discloses feelings of depression: percent agreement 85% kappa 0.67; 2) Tweet is a supportive or helpful message about depression: percent agreement 85% kappa 0.70; 3) Tweeter discloses feeling school or work-related pressures related to depression: percent agreement 98% kappa 0.72; 4) Tweeter engages in substance use to deal with depression: percent agreement 100% kappa 1.0; 5) Tweeter discloses self-harm or suicidal thoughts: percent agreement 98% kappa 0.56; 6) trivial disclosures of depression: percent agreement 90% kappa 0.70; 7) source of Tweet: percent agreement 91% kappa 0.51. Because both prevalence of and kappa for diminished ability to think/concentrate were low we chose not to report on this code.,Demographics Pro was used to infer the demographic characteristics of the individuals who disclosed feeling depressed in the tweets that were examined in the present study (Demographics Pro for Twitter 2014). The demographic characteristics examined include: age gender race/ethnicity marital status income occupation and location of the Tweeter. In order to assess for patterns in Twitter interests the most likely Twitter handles that are being followed by the Tweeters were also provided. Demographics Pro uses a series of proprietary algorithms to estimate or infer likely demographic characteristics of Twitter handles based on Twitter behavior/usage. Their predictions rely on multiple data signals from networks (signals imparted by the nature and strength of ties between individuals on Twitter) consumption (consumption of information on Twitter revealed by accounts followed and real-world consumption revealed by Twitter usage) and language (words and phrased used in tweets and bios). Demographics Pro has used their methodology to profile some 300 million Twitter users to date and requires confidence of 95% or above to make an estimate of a single demographic characteristic. For example if 10000 predictions are made 9500 would need to be correct in order to accept the methodology used to make the prediction. The success of the Demographics Pro analytic predictions relies on the relatively low covariance of multiple amplified signals. Iterative evaluation testing the methodologies on training sets of established samples of Twitter users with verified demographics allows the calibration of balance between depth of coverage (the number of demographic predictions made) and required accuracy. The size of these established samples of Twitter users with verified demographics varies from 10000 to 200000 people depending on the specific demographic characteristic to be inferred. For comparison purposes inferred demographic characteristics across a sample of 20000 randomly selected English-language Twitter users in the U.S. and Canada were also provided by Demographics Pro. We used Pearson chi square tests to compare the inferred characteristics of Tweeters from our sample who expressed feelings of depression versus the typical Twitter user. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
https://aclanthology.org/W15-1202.pdf,Quantifying the Language of Schizophrenia in Social Media,Data Drawbacks of a Balanced Dataset Concomitance,2,We follow the data acquisition and curation process of Coppersmith et al. (2014a) summarizing the major points here: Social media such as Twitter contains frequent public statements by users reporting diagnoses for various medical conditions. Many talk about physical health conditions (e.g. cancer flu) but some also discuss mental illness including schizophrenia. There are a variety of motivations for users to share this information on social media: to offer or seek support to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps to offer an explanation for certain behaviors.4 We obtain messages with these self-reported diagnoses using the Twitter API and filtered via (caseinsensitive) regular expression to require “schizo” or a close phonetic approximation to be present; our expression matched “schizophrenia” its subtypes and various approximations: “schizo” “skitzo” “skitso” “schizotypal” “schizoid” etc. All data we collect are public posts made between 2008 and 2015 and exclude any message marked as ‘private’ by the author. All use of the data reported in this paper has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB). Each self-stated diagnosis included in this study was examined by a human annotator (one of the authors) to verify that it appeared to be a genuine statement of a schizophrenia diagnosis excluding jokes quotes or disingenuous statements. We obtained 174 users with an apparently genuine selfstated diagnosis of a schizophrenia-related condition. Note that we cannot be certain that the Twitter user was actually diagnosed with schizophrenia only that their statement of being diagnosed appears to be genuine. Previous work indicates that interannotator agreement for this task is good: κ = 0.77 (Coppersmith et al. 2014a). For each user we obtained a set of their public Twitter posts via the Twitter API collecting up to 3200 tweets.5 As we wish to focus on user-authored content we exclude from analysis all retweets and any tweets that contain a URL (which often contain text that the user did not author). We lowercase all words and convert any non-standard characters (including emoji) to a systematic ASCII representation via Unidecode.6 For our community controls we used randomlyselected Twitter users who primarily tweet in English. Specifically during a two week period in early 2014 each Twitter user who was included in Twitter’s 1% “spritzer” sample had an equal chance for inclusion in our pool of community controls. We then collected some of their historic tweets and assessed the language(s) they tweeted in according to the Chromium Compact Language Detector.7 Users were excluded from our community controls if their tweets were less than 75% English.8,We use a balanced dataset here for our analysis (an equal number of schizophrenia users and community controls). This 50/50 split makes the machine learning and analysis easier and will allow us to focus more on emergent linguistics that are related to schizophrenia than if we had examined a dataset more representative of the population (more like 1/99). Moreover we have not factored in the cost of false negatives or false positives (how should the consequences of misclassifying a schizophrenia user as non-schizophrenic be weighed against the consequences of misclassifying a non-schizophrenic user as schizophrenic?). All our classification results should be taken as validation that the differences in language we observe are relevant to schizophrenia but only one step towards applying something derived from this technology in a real world scenario.,Often people suffering from mental illness have a diagnosis for more than one disorder and schizophrenia is no exception. Of our 174 users with a genuine self-statement of diagnosis of a schizophrenia-related condition 41 also state a diagnosis of at least one other mental illness (30%) while 15 of those state that they have a diagnosis of more than one other mental illness (11%). The vast majority of these concomitances are with bipolar (25 users) followed by depression (14) post traumatic stress disorder (8) and generalized anxiety disorder (6). These comorbidity rates are notably lower than the generally accepted prevalence rates which may be due to one of several factors. First we rely on stated diagnoses to calculate comorbidity and the users may not be stating each of their diagnosed conditions either because they have not been diagnosed as such or they choose to identify most strongly with the stated diagnosed conditions or they simply ran out of space (given Twitter’s 140-character limit). Second we are analyzing Twitter users which consists of only a subset of the population and the users that choose to state publicly on Twitter their schizophrenia diagnosis may not be an accurate representation of the population of schizophrenia sufferers. The noted concomitance of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is frequently labeled as “schizoaffective disorder with a bipolar subtype” with some recent research indicating shared impairments in functional connectivity across patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (Meda et al. 2012). It is worth keeping in mind throughout this paper that we examine all subtypes of schizophrenia together here and further in-depth analysis between subtypes is warranted.
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2700171.2791026,Detecting Changes in Suicide Content Manifested in Social Media Following Celebrity Suicides,Wikipedia Data,2,Next we compiled a list of reported celebrity suicides which fell within the time range of our Reddit data. Defining who is a “celebrity” is nontrivial so we refer to the Wikipedia page listing celebrity suicides7 as a way to measure who has sufficient celebrity status for inclusion. We obtained 10 reported celebrity suicides in the same period as our Reddit data; their names and reported suicides are shown in Table 2. We measure the prominence of a celebrity’s death by measuring the change in Wikipedia page views for the celebrity’s Wikipedia page. Wikipedia provides daily page view statistics for each page.8 We compare the number of page-views in the two weeks prior to their death with the two weeks following their death in terms of z-score (Figure 1). Here z-scores are computed by converting the page views to standard normal variable with 0-mean and standard deviation of 1. For 9/10 of the cases we see a notable spike in number of views showing that the suicides of these individuals were well-known enough to be viewable on such a macro scale and for examining the presence of Werther Effect in social media. We note two aspects related to the above analysis and which will be used through the rest of this paper. First since we are focusing on different types of data sources—Wikipedia and Reddit we use z-score conversion as a normalization technique for the Wikipedia page views and Reddit’s SW posting activity volume. Further the above observation in Wikipedia data and the analyses that ensue focus on observing changes over a two week window preceding and succeeding a celebrity suicide; this choice is motivated by our initial analyses and from the literature on Werther Effect [17].,,
https://aclanthology.org/W17-3110.pdf,Small but Mighty: Affective Micropatterns for Quantifying Mental Health from Social Media Language,Caveats,2,All of the following analysis is subject to a few caveats emergent from the data and how the data were collected. The users with mental health conditions are all found data of one sort or another so there are some inherent biases. We prefer to express these biases rather than add complexity by attempting to cleverly correct for them. Many of these users talk publicly about their mental health which given the stigma and discrimination they face is likely a distinct subpopulation of those with mental health conditions. It is possible that users with a psychological disorder or suicide history who did not publicly disclose this information could have been included in the control group for analyses which may have the effect of artificially lowering the estimated power of any emergent differences. Users who donated data through OurDataHelps.org are likely biased differently with over representation of altruism since they are willing to do things for the public good without any obvious self gain. Another consideration is that all users who reported a suicide attempt within our dataset survived. There is a possibility that characteristic differences also exist between individuals who do and do not die by a suicide attempt. Note that this research was conducted on English-speaking social media users. The content of social media post micropatterns for psychological disorders and suicidality could differ between cultural contexts due to differences in cross-cultural expressions of mental illness (Chentsova-Dutton et al. 2007). These are active Twitter users which imparts a demographic skew compared to the rest of the world (in particular these users skew young). We see more females in our user populations than the rough gender balance observed for general Twitter users (Greenwood et al. 2016). The language data itself is meant for public consumption and may reflect how the authors wish to be perceived and not what one would get from a more traditional journal study of internal and private thoughts and feelings. Finally we include users who had a concomittant or comorbid mental health condition. Thus a small number of users appear in more than one category.,,

Hence we devise a subsampling strategy to filter users belonging to one of the four countries from the set of users in the candidate disclosure and the control datasets with inferrable country information. First for population based subsampling we use the inverse of the population ranks of the countries4 as the respective rates of sampling. Then we use the internet penetration percentages of the countries5 to randomly sample that fraction of users from the population subsampled sets. In this manner across both the datasets we obtained 211132 Twitter users from the US 61816 users from the UK 10808 from IN and 5769 from ZA.,Next we also note that it is possible that our candidate control dataset includes users who engage in mental illness in their posts however did not use any of the keyphrases from Table 1. To eliminate such users like above we compare the language used in the Twitter posts of these users with that of the Reddit mental health posts. However in this case we are interested in the users whose language is most distinct (or least similar) from that used in the Reddit content. Hence our final control dataset is obtained by filtering for those users whose language model based similarity is less than the median similarity across all control user vectors (238860 users; median distance=.38; σ = .125). See Figure 1(b) for a distribution of the cosine cosine similarities. We will refer to this dataset as CTL users (ref. Figure 2 for the approach).,
https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e14199/,Detecting Signs of Depression in Tweets in Spanish: Behavioral and Linguistic Analysis,Data Collection and User Selections,1,The selection of the tweets and their users was based on the filtered real-time streaming support provided by the Twitter API. In the first step we selected the users who showed potential signs of depression on Twitter on the basis of the 20 most frequent words in Spanish expressed by patients suffering from depression in clinical settings. These words were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general features of depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [42]. The list of words used and their English translations are shown in Textbox 1. During June 2018 1470000 tweets including 1 or more occurrences of the words listed in Textbox 1 were collected. From this collection of tweets and to select the users who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile descriptions including 1 or more occurrences of the word “depr” and all the possible derivations related to the word depression in Spanish such as “depre” “depresión” “depresivo” “depresiva” “deprimido” and “deprimida” were considered. From the 720 users who included 1 or more of these words in their description profile 90 users who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis. This selection was performed by a psychologist verifying that the statements were related to real expressions of depression excluding quotes jokes or fake ones. For each of these depressed Twitter users we collected all the most recent tweets from their timeline up to a maximum of about 3200 tweets. Thus a total of 189669 tweets were collected a figure that was reduced to 140946 after discarding the retweets. These 140946 tweets constituted the depressive users dataset. Examples of sentences appearing in the user profiles that were used for selecting the depressive users are: “Paciente psiquiátrico con depresión crónica” (Psychiatric patient with chronic depression; example of a profile sentence that indicates depression). “Colecciono errores traducidos a tweets depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor” (I gather errors translated into depressing tweets and into one or another love impulse; example of a profile sentence that does not indicate depression). Once the users with profile sentences indicating depression had been retrieved their Twitter timelines were collected. Only those users having in their timeline at least 10 tweets that suggested signs of depression were retained for further analyses. For each user the selection of these tweets was performed by manually inspecting the tweets of the user’s complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by means of the Twitter API . Finally a total number of 1000 tweets issued by the 90 depressive users suggesting signs of depression were detected and used for the analysis. This set of tweets provided us with the depressive tweets dataset which was used to analyze linguistic features of tweets showing signs of depression. It has to be mentioned that these 1000 tweets were not to be included in the depressive users dataset (see Figure 1). At the same time more than 97500000 tweets were also collected in June 2018: such tweets were gathered by listening to the public Twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweets with Spanish textual contents (as detected by Twitter language identification support). Given that Twitter requires more restrictive filters than just the language of the tweets we used a list of the most frequently used Spanish words (stopwords) to retrieve all tweets that included 1 or more of these words. The vast majority of Spanish tweets should match this criterion. A sample of 450 users who did not mention in their profile the word depression and its derivations were selected randomly from the 97500000 tweets. The complete timelines of these users were compiled (1141021 tweets) which were reduced to 712589 once retweets were removed. These 712589 tweets constituted the control dataset. To identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by Twitter for each tweet selecting tweets in Spanish. It has to be noted that these data can contain some tweets from unidentified depressive users.,,
https://aclanthology.org/W18-0608.pdf,Cross-cultural differences in language markers of depression online,Data Collection Measures,0,Data was collected from 7 Cups of Tea an anonymous online chat-based peer support community for emotional distress1 . Users agree at signup that their data may be used for the purposes of research. All the data used for the current study was anonymous and securely stored. This research was performed in line with the ethical and privacy protocols outlined in detail in (Benton et al. 2017). Data from 7 Cups takes the form of written dialogue between users of the service and volunteers who are trained as “active listeners”. A fragment of an exchange between the user of the service (U) and the volunteer (V) might go as follows: For the analyses reported in this paper we used only text generated by users of the service not the volunteers providing peer support. Users who reported depression as their primary concern at sign up were eligible for inclusion in analyses. Our original sample was comprised of 23048 conversations involving 1937 unique users. Users were excluded from the sample if they did not indicate their culture or if they selected ‘Other’. This resulted in the exclusion of 199 and 130 users respectively. The original sample also included users identifying as Native American or American Indian. This group was excluded from analyses since the majority of the data among these users was not English. This resulted in the removal of 15 users leaving a total sample size of 1593.,Users of the service completed a questionnaire at sign-up in which they provided information about their demographic characteristics and mental health. Demographic characteristics assessed included age gender and ethnicity. Ethnicity response categories were White Asian or Pacific Islander Black or African American Latino or Hispanic Native American or American Indian or Other. Users could only select one ethnic group category. Users also select the primary reason for using 7 Cups and the users above all indicated a primary purpose of “Depression”.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359169,Cross-Cultural Differences in the Use of Online Mental Health Support Forums,Method of Analysis,2,"Selection Criteria and Data Scope. To understand the impact of cultural differences on how individuals use online mental health platforms we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of users from different national communities on Talklife a support platform with over half a million users [91]. For this analysis due to the fact that most research in CSCW on mental health online has been done either agnostic of cultural context [12 34] or in a Western context [60 67 88] we choose to focus on users from non-Western countries following Zhang et al. [103]. As researchers located in the Global South and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory models [52] of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of CSCW and CSCWadjacent mental health research away from the West is crucial to better meet the needs of people often underserved by the medical system [70]. To create these subgroups of users we choose the three non-Western countries with the highest user populations on Talklife or India Malaysia and the Philippines. Guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuances to mental health expression for each country [35 62 77 80] we examine the national identity linguistic and behavior-based differences of use between each user subgroup. In particular this research notes that as a result of cultural norms around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualizations of mental illness in India Malaysia and the Philippines symptoms are often expressed in somatic and religious terms as opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric terms. We choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reasons. On a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity has commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity [31 33 52]. Additionally on a more practical level each user’s country was determined using their IP address by Talklife and shared with us in an user-anonymized dataset. Inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity as discussed in past work [47] and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural differences than analysis at the national level. We analyze data from 10532 Indian users 3370 Malaysian users and 3370 Filipino users as shown in Table 2. Collectively we refer to these countries as the minority sample. As a comparison set we construct a random sample of all threads on Talklife and refer to it as the majority sample. Due to the relative prevalence of users from Western English-speaking countries in Talklife most of the threads in the majority sample include posts from countries such as the USA UK and Canada. Indians are the largest non-Western minority subgroup on Talklife. Data was sampled from May 2012 to June 2018. Following this cross-national analysis to see if our broader results on Talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest Western country (the United States) and the largest non-Western country (India) represented on 7Cups a similar support platform with more than 15000 users actively using the platform each week [7]. Using 7Cups data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural differences we found in our Talklife sample. For this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from 6055 Indian users and 18581 American users as shown in Table 2. Unlike our sample of Talklife users this dataset is not a random sample. There is an upsampling of Indian users to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of Indians in the dataset. Like on Talklife Indians are the largest non-Western minority subgroup on 7Cups. We focus on Indian users due to a lack of sufficient data on users from Malaysia or the Philippines. Data was sampled from March 2014 - August 2018. 3.1.2 Defining Cultural Identity and Use of Clinical Language. In this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forums. To do so we leverage Tomlinson’s definition of cultural identity as “self and communal definitions based around specific usually politically inflected differentiations: gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality"" [94] particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that runs along national lines as delineated by Hall et al. [41]. As a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other forms of identity including religious or ethnic identity. However in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity as a proxy for cultural identity. Additionally following Schlesinger et al’s [83] call for more intersectional analyses and methods within HCI we also include analyses of adjacent and intersecting identities when relevant including religious identity. To analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnoses. Following methods used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language [30] we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigrams and trigrams from a list of mental disorders as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [100]. We also included all unigrams from the MacMillan Dictionary list of words used to describe illnesses and diseases both specifically for mental illness and general illness [1–3]. As a result we include unigrams like “night"" (from night terrors) or sleep (from “sleep disorder"") as these are often correlated with specific symptoms of mental illness or distress such as sleep issues or being awake at night [30]. This included any clinically common abbreviations for mental disorders such as OCD for “obsessive compulsive disorder"" or BPD for “borderline personality disorder."" Shorthand for disorders commonly used by online communities such as “pro-ana” (as used in pro-eating disorder communities) [22] were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these terms across disorders. We choose to use terms from and associated with DSM and ICD categorized disorders as a result of the common usage of these frameworks globally [99]. Throughout our analysis of these varied factors we use µ to represent means and σ to represent standard deviations. 3.1.3 Constraints Limitations and Tradeoffs. Cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting levels including subcultures and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity. As a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraints in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis. One large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level as a proxy for cultural identity. Though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity as argued by both Hall [41] and Tomlinson [94] each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identities that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity [54 64 89]. A more rich analysis of these other forms of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusions about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support communities particularly with regard to cultural differences between users with the same national identity. Additionally to stay consistent between analyses as a result of a lack of data on users from Malaysia and the Philippines we only analyze users in India on 7Cups and extend these findings to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum. We draw validity for these exploratory findings from similar consistent patterns we observe between Indian Malaysian and Filipino users but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority communities these conclusions do not hold true. Additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used DSM and ICD both frameworks of illness categorization have significant limitations particularly in the countries we have selected. For example there are both mental health disorders that are culturebound [74] as well as mental health language that is used in different ways within the specific countries we analyze such as depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illnesses [53]. Additionally it is clear that online support communities often develop their own cultural norms and language around mental health [21 72] and a deeper understanding of how this plays out on Talklife and 7Cups is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work. In this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical terms for mental health disorders in our analysis of clinical language. As detailed in past anthropological research [52] it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across cultures as a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder as opposed to conceptualizing distress as “stress"" “tension"" or “depression"" [25 53 98]. For our analysis we strictly analyzed posts that were in the Latin alphabet with almost all posts on both Talklife and 7Cups being in English. However as both Malay [8] and Tagalog [82] are most commonly written in the Latin script and since it is common for users from India speakers to use romanized versions of Indian languages online [79] it is possible that a small minority of posts in our analysis were text in a different language. However as confirmed by only seeing English words used in our analysis of the top n-grams among each user subgroup it is clear that English is the predominant language on both platforms. Though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of non-English code-switching on these platforms could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interactions on expression between users with the same national identity but different language preferences.",,
https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2197-z,Automatic extraction of informal topics from online suicidal ideation,Suicide Watch,0,In this section we first present the data gathered and used in our analysis. Researchers interested in the code and the data are invited to contact the authors. Reddit is a website which enables users to aggregate rate and discuss news entertainment politics and many other topics. According to Alexa it is the 8th most popular website in the world. It was estimated by the Pew research center that 6% of online adults use Reddit [26]. The site is organized into a collection of “subreddits” each focused on a particular topic and administered by a collection of moderators. The subreddit r/SuicideWatch is a forum in which online users are encouraged to post their thoughts regarding suicide. At the time of our data collection it had over 58000 subscribers. Sometimes users express a preoccupation with the thought of suicide. Other times users discuss immediate plans to take their own life. These posts often contain a description of their mental state including depression reaction to stress their feelings of being alone and having a low self-esteem. While most online sources of data are notoriously noisy this particular subreddit is remarkably clean. Given the serious nature of the subreddit individuals are less likely to post harassing comments or off-topic remarks. When users post such comments the moderators of the subreddit quickly remove them. We collected all posts from its inception in 2008 to 2016. Each post is often commented on by other individuals. In this work we focused on the original post as it most often represents the suicidal ideation of a user and comments often represent emotional support from other users. We cleaned this data. First we removed empty posts in which the content had been deleted. Second we removed links and replaced them with the word “link”. Third we concatenated the text of the post to the title as many users begin their post in the title and continue in the body of the post. Finally we removed punctuation and other special characters. After cleaning this data we had 131728 posts with 27978246 words of which 84607 words were unique posted by 63252 unique users.,,
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8609647,Online Social Networks in Health Care: A Study of Mental Disorders on Reddit,Dataset User Interactions Model and Discussion Trees Relationship Modeling Network (RMN),0,Reddit is a multilingual Online Social Network founded in 2005 and organized in subcommunities by areas of interest called subreddits. We obtained data from the Reddit's data repository4 focusing on four subreddits where people discuss issues related to mental heath disorders: Depression (/r/depression) Suicide Watch (/r/Suicide Watch) Anxiety (/r/anxiety) and Bipolar (/r/bipolar). Our dataset is comprised of user activities (posts and comments) that took place between 2011 and 201 7. Here we focus on data from January 2017 to December 2017. In total we obtained 261511 posts and 1256669 comments from 184708 unique users. Table I shows the total number of users posts and comments per subreddit. The total number of comments in each community is at least 4.2 times larger than the number of posts which suggests a supportive behavior among users.,We model user interactions as a weighted directed graph G where each node represents a user each directed edge (u v) indicates that user u commented on one or more posts made by user v and the edge weight is equal to the number of u’s comments summed over all v’s posts. Given a user u in G the in-degree of u is the number of users who interact with user u i.e. the number of unique users who commented on posts from u. The out-degree of u in turn is the number of interactions u had within the community i.e. the number of posts u commented on. Social support is the process of interactions in relationships which improves coping esteem belonging and competence through actual or perceived exchanges of psychosocial resources (adapted from [14]). In addition to measuring support from the interaction graph we also measure it from discussion trees. In a discussion tree the root node corresponds to a post while other nodes correspond to comments made either in response to the post or to other comments in the same thread. Analyzing tree sizes (depth) and shapes (width) can shed some light on the topics that most attract user attention as well as pinpoint key members in each community. For instance a highly emotional comment can trigger more reactions than the original post i.e. the majority of the discussion might be concentrated in one of the branches.,RMN is a recursive neural network designed to model relationships between pairs of entities from text [13]. Each relationship is represented at a given point in time as a vector of weights over K descriptors. Entities that form a relationship do not need to be of the same class: for example in this work we model the relationships between a user and the community in which she interacts. Each post or comment corresponds to a different instant. Words are represented as embeddings of dimension P that is each word w of a vocabulary V is a vector in RP . Users and communities are represented by embeddings of dimension U and C respectively. As in previous works we generated embeddings using GloVe [15]. The descriptors obtained from RMN are vectors in RP  allowing us to find the closest words to each descriptor. The post’s (or comment’s) representation is denoted by vpost ∈ RP . This vector is the average of the word embeddings contained in the post. The representations of users and communities are denoted by vuser and vcomm. For each post or comment RMN takes as input a vector v ∈ RP +U+C obtained by concatenating vpost vuser and vcomm. These vectors are combined through the weights of the neural network to obtain a representation dt ∈ RK of the relationship between the user and the community at that particular time. RMN uses a smoothing parameter α ∈ (0 1) to avoid abrupt changes in the representation of the same relation in consecutive instants dt and dt−1. The descriptor array R ∈ RK×P is used for attempting to reconstruct the post vpost by making rt = Rdt. RMN parameters (weights and matrix of descriptors) are trained in order to maximize an objective function that aims to approximate rt and vpost while retaining some distance between rt and other randomly sampled posts. See [13] for more details on RMN. The input data for RMN was preprocessed as follows. First we removed all posts and comments marked as [deleted] or [removed] standard stop-words (using the NLTK library) punctuation and accents. Second for each subreddit we removed posts and comments from users who performed less than 50 activities (posts or comments) following the methodology presented in [16]. Finally we selected the words that appear at least once in each of the four subreddits analyzed seeking to find similarities in the way people express themselves when discussing mental health disorders. The final subset of data analyzed by RMN is composed of 18020 unique words 25101 posts and 401428 comments.
