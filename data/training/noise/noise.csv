Our surveys were only visible to MTurk crowdworkers who had completed at least  previous tasks with a minimum % approval rating; MTurk workers with this level of experience and approval rating have been found to provide reliable valid survey responses []. We also restricted access to only American IP addresses as MTurk data collected from outside the United States are generally of poorer quality []. All participants were only permitted to take the survey once. We excluded participants who had successfully completed our survey but who had a lifetime total of fewer than five Instagram posts. We also excluded participants with CESD scores of  or higher. Studies have indicated that a CES-D score of  represents an optimal cutoff for identifying clinically relevant depression across a range of age groups and circumstances [ ].,,

The MHs have been previously examined for understanding mental health discourse on Reddit [51 39]. For SW we consulted (1) a licensed clinical psychologist/suicide prevention expert and (2) two active moderators of SW to obtain qualitative grounding that the content in SW indeed related to expressions of suicidal ideation. Example (paraphrased) titles of posts from one of the MHs and SW are given in Table 1.,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702613.2732733,Detecting and Characterizing Mental Health Related Self-Disclosure in Social Media,Generating Ground Truth Data on Self-Disclosure,0,Automatic detection of self-disclosure levels in posts necessitates obtaining gold standard labels on self-disclosure in essence “ground truth”. For the purpose two raters familiar with Reddit and its mental health communities in particular independently rated a small random sample (50 posts) with equal proportions from mental health and control subreddits for three levels of self-disclosure – no selfdisclosure low and high self-disclosure. These three classes of self-disclosure were chosen based on categorization by Bak et al in [10]. The raters mutually discussed their labels thereafter and thus came up with a set of rules for rating. The rules were further aligned with observations in prior work [9 10 11]. Per the rules: Posts that either reveal personal information (e.g. age location gender etc.) or divulge sensitive or vulnerable thoughts beliefs or embarrassing/confessional experiences were to be considered to be indicative of high self-disclosure. Joinson [10] characterized sensitive disclosure in terms of the extent of “revealed vulnerability”. Posts about self but not disclosing any personal or emotionally vulnerable content was to be considered of low self-disclosure. No self-disclosure posts were those which were about people or things other than the posting author and which divulged information unrelated to the self. Following these mutually agreed upon rules the previous two raters and an additional rater familiar with Reddit independently coded a larger sample of 800 posts to create a training set for the purposes of classification. The raters had good agreement in their ratings: Fleiss’ Kappa was found to be .73. However given the subjective nature of characterization of self-disclosure we considered only those posts in the training set for which we had agreement across all three raters – this gave us 627 posts. Across the three categories the coded set consisted of 38% posts of high selfdisclosure 35% posts of low self-disclosure and 27% with no self-disclosure. Table 3 gives examples of mental health post excerpts with high self-disclosure while Table 4 and 5 provide examples of low and no self-disclosure posts. Note that including non-mental health posts in the training set was essential so as to let the detector learn on posts of low and no self-disclosure and on those not mental health related.,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702280,Recognizing Depression from Twitter Activity,Data Gathering,1,In this study we gathered information on depression levels of Twitter users and their activity histories. To do this we published a website to administer a questionnaire and disseminated information about the website over Twitter1. In contrast to De Choudhury et al. [14] who collected data from Englishspeaking users through crowdsourcing this study collected data from Japanese-speaking volunteers. This approach was used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research [14]. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of our website. The website collected the responses to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the Twitter users who participated (hereinafter the participants) and to collect the histories of participants activities on Twitter. The activity histories of participants were collected through the Twitter application programming interface (API)2 and the questionnaires to determine degree of depression were completed by participants through their web browsers. Before data collection visitors to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aims of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled. Those who consented to become participants after receiving the explanation logged into their individual Twitter accounts through the OAuth authorization process. Next participants were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression. A message called the “kokoro score” (“kokoro” is a Japanese word meaning “heart”) determined on the basis of answers to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweets was displayed to participants after completion of the questionnaire (Fig. 2). Experiment participants were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over Twitter by word-of-mouth in a type of snowball sampling. The CES-D questionnaire was used to evaluate the degree of depression [30]. In the CES-D test participants answered 20 questions on a Likert-type 4-point scale. Each answer was assigned a score of 0-3 points with the sum of the points from all answers used as the score to estimate likelihood of depression. Several standards exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression. In this research we regarded a score of 22 points or higher as indicating active depression and a score of 21 points or lower as indicating no active depression; these are the same values as used in [14] and give a cutoff score of 22. In addition answers to BDI [2] a depression scale used with characteristics similar to CESD were collected to ensure the reliability of data. For each participant scores were calculated on both scales with poor correlation regarded as indicating unreliable answers. The time taken to answer the questionnaires was also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded. After each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on Twitter was collected from Twitter by using the API. At most 3200 tweets were collected for each participant and the number of users following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded. Tweets published after the questionnaire was taken were discarded. The website was opened to the public on 4 December 2013 at which time the authors publicized it on their Twitter accounts. Between 4 December 2013 and 8 February 2014 219 people participated in the experiment. After eliminating participants who did not tweet and participants who answered the questionnaire in fewer than 30 seconds (as previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answers) 214 sets of answers remained. Only the first set of answers was used for participants who completed the questionnaire more than once. As a result data about 209 experiment participants (male: 121; female: 88) aged 16 to 55 (mean: 28.8 years; standard deviation: 8.2 years) were analyzed. The correlations between CES-D score and BDI score for these participants were high 0.87 and there were no participants with uncorrelated scores so the data for all 209 participants were used; excluded datasets are not discussed any further. Figure 3 shows the histogram of CES-D scores of 209 participants. Among the participants 81 (resp. 128) were estimated to have (resp. not have) active depression for an incidence of approximately 39%. This incidence is similar to that found by De Choudhury et al. [14] who identified depression in approximately 36% of participants. Table 1 gives statistics on the activity histories of participants.,,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12961-9,Forecasting the onset and course of mental illness with Twitter data,Improvind Data Quality,2,In an effort to minimize noisy and unreliable data we applied several quality assurance measures in our data collection process. MTurk workers who have completed at least 100 tasks with a minimum 95% approval rating have been found to provide reliable valid survey responses33. We restricted survey visibility only to workers with these qualifications. Survey access was also restricted to U.S. IP addresses as MTurk data collected from outside the United States are generally of poorer quality34. All participants were only permitted to take the survey once. We excluded participants with a total of fewer than five Twitter posts. We also excluded participants with CES-D scores of 21 or lower (depression) or TSQ scores of 5 or lower (PTSD). Studies have indicated that a CES-D score of 22 represents an optimal cutoff for identifying clinically relevant depression3536; an equivalent TSQ cutoff of 6 has been found to be optimal in the case of PTSD32. We note here that in the study that inspired the present work De Choudhury et al.8 used two depression scales (CES-D and BDI) and filtered individuals whose depression score did not correlate across the both scales. This additional criteria is a methodological strength of De Choudhury et al.8 with respect to the present work.,,
https://aclanthology.org/W14-3214.pdf,Towards Assessing Changes in Degree of Depression through Facebook,Dataset,0,We used a dataset of 28749 nonclinical users who opted into a Facebook application (“MyPersonality”; Kosinski and Stillwell 2012) between June 2009 and March 2011 completed a 100-item personality questionnaire (an International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) proxy to the NEO-PI-R (Goldberg 1999) and shared access to their status updates containing at least 500 words. Users wrote on average of 4236 words (69917624 total word instances) and a subset of 16507 users provided gender and age in which 57.0% were female and the mean age was 24.8. The dataset was divided into training and testing samples. In particular the testing sample consisted of a random set of 1000 users who wrote at least 1000 words and completed the personality measure while the training set contained the 27749 remaining users.,,
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6784326,Affective and Content Analysis of Online Depression Communities,Feature Extraction,0,To characterize the difference between CLINICAL and CONTROL communities a variety of features are extracted: Affective features: We use the lexicon—Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) [5]—to extract the sentiment conveyed in the content. This lexicon consists of 1034 words rated in terms of valence and arousal and is thus suitable for a quantitative estimation. The valence of ANEW words is on a scale of 1 (very unpleasant) to 9 (very pleasant). The arousal is measured on the same scale—1 (least active) to 9 (most active). A cloud visualization of ANEW words used in the blog posts made by CLINICAL and CONTROL groups is illustrated in Fig. 1. Mood tags: LiveJournal provides a mechanism for users to tag their posts from a list of 132 pre-defined mood labels.4 Thus in addition to the emotion expressed in the text of posts the mood tag produced allows us direct access to the user sentiment. A cloud visualization of moods tagged on blog posts made by CLINICAL and CONTROL communities is llustrated in Fig. 2. LIWC features: We examine the proportions of words in psycholinguistic categories as defined in the LIWC package [27]: linguistic social affective cognitive perceptual biological relativity personal concerns and spoken.5 Table 3 presents the mean of these LIWC psycholinguistic processes for the CLINICAL and CONTROL communities. Whilst similar in the use words with positive emotion people in the CLINICAL communities tend to use words with more negative emotion—as examples anxiety anger and sadness. Further they discuss more issues about health and death in comparison with the CONTROL group. On the other hand the users in the CONTROL group discuss more neutral life related topics—ingestion home and leisure words. Topics: For extracting topics latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [4] is used as a Bayesian probabilistic modelling framework. LDA extracts the probabilities —that is words in a topic and then assigns a topic to each word in a document. For the inference part we implemented Gibbs inference detailed in [10]. We set the number of topics to 50 run the Gibbs for 5000 samples and use the last Gibbs sample to interpret the results.,,
https://www.jmir.org/2017/7/e243/,Assessing Suicide Risk and Emotional Distress in Chinese Social Media: A Text Mining and Machine Learning Study,Data Collection,0,A Web-based survey of Weibo users was conducted to assess the respondents’ suicide risk and emotional distress (ie depression anxiety and stress). The invitation letter to participate in this survey was widely sent out to general Weibo users by various promotion activities. For a Weibo user to be eligible for the study she or he had to be 18 years or older (by self-report). A 30 Renminbi incentive for each complete survey was provided to boost the respond rate. With the respondents’ consent their Weibo posts that were posted in the public domain during the 12 months before the survey were downloaded by calling Weibo API. The survey fulfilled the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) checklist and details of the procedure have been reported in previous publications [2232]. In addition when multiple survey feedback were submitted from the same Internet protocol addresses only the first submission was used to avoid duplicate participation. In contrast to a previous study [32] this study excluded those who posted nothing throughout the 12 months but not those who posted fewer than 100 posts. Eventually data provided by 974 respondents remained for further analyses. The study has obtained ethical approvals from the Human Research Ethical Review Committee at the University of Hong Kong and the Institute Review Board of the Institute of Psychology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The survey measured respondents’ suicide probability score depression anxiety stress and Weibo suicide communication (WSC) as the outcome variables. In addition the respondents’ Weibo posts language features were extracted as independent variables or features for machine learning. The details of how those data were obtained are elaborated in the following subsections.,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,A Social Media Based Index of Mental Well-Being in College Campuses,Data,0,We first obtained a list of 150 ranked major universities in the United States by crawling the US News and World Report website [48]. This list is constructed based on the Carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researchers and using a set of 16 indicators of academic excellence defined by US News. The list includes a variety of universities spread across the US in different settings (e.g. urban rural) and with a wide range of student enrollment sizes. Figure 1(a) shows their geographic distribution. As a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata: gender distribution of students average tuition and fees and academic calendar (semester/quarter). To obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the Wikipedia pages of all of the 150 universities. From these pages we extracted the size of student enrollment type (public/private) and setting (rural/suburban/urban/city) at every institution. These definitions come from a formal categorization scheme used by the US Department of Education. The student body enrollment sizes ranged from 2255 to 97494 with 98 public and 52 private universities. 50 universities were reported to be urban 47 city 39 suburban and 13 rural. Finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the universities from a website known as Priceonomics [58]. The website calculates the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) by combining the race/ethnicity distribution of student bodies at different universities with data given from the Department of Education. HHI ranges from 1 (the least diverse: a population of all one type) to 1/N (the most diverse) where N is the number of different racial categories being analyzed. Social Media Data of Universities Next we obtained social media data of the above universities. Specifically we focused on the social media Reddit. Why Reddit? Reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social media site among the college student demographic [23]. Due to its forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing as well as for obtaining feedback and information from communities of interest. Reddit harbors a variety of communities known as “subreddits” including many dedicated to specific university campuses. This allows a large sample of posts shared by students of a university to be collected in one place. Our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits (e.g. r/gatech or r/KState) revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by students to discuss college topics (Table 1). Focusing on these public Reddit communities also does not require explicit data collection efforts to be coordinated at each of the 150 university sites. Although more students are likely to use Facebook due to its largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university’s students. Next while Twitter is also widely adopted without explicit self-reported information it is challenging to identify college student accounts. Finally prior work [2 18] notes that semianonymity of Reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topics like mental health. Initial Data Acquisition. We leveraged the archive of all of Reddit data made available on Google’s BigQuery [11]. BigQuery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third parties to access large publicly available dataset through simple SQL-type queries. Our queries grabbed all posts ranging between June 2011 and February 2016 available in the Reddit data archive. This included 424984 posts from 153378 unique users across all of the 146 universities with a mean of 2910.8 posts ( = 4329.6) and 1050 unique users ( = 1407) per subreddit. Filling the Gaps in Subreddit Data. The second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection. Through Reddit’s official API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) we obtained the most recent number of subscribers in the 146 university subreddits (as of July 2016). Then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data as given in step 1 we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit. This allows us to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative. For subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median (.42) (73 in all) we performed a one-time data collection using the Reddit API. This gave us a set of (at most) 1000 most recent posts for each subreddit with a total of 39824 posts added to the data obtained in step 1 following de-duplication. We note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distributions of data across the subreddits: The skew (yearly rate of change) before and after data filling were 4.86 and 5.05 respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a two-sample equivalence test (p = .013 p = .025) a test that uses two one-sided t-tests on the before-after yearly rates of change from both sides of a chosen difference interval [1 1].,,
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7752434,MIDAS: Mental illness detection and analysis via social media,Feature Extraction,0,In this work we are focused on two main type of features (linguistic and behavioral). TF-IDF is adopted to model the linguist features of patients and Pattern of Life Features (PLF) adopted from the work of Coppersmith et al. [1] is used to model the behavioral style of patients. TF-IDF Features To capture the frequent and representative words used by the patients TF-IDF is applied on the unigram and bigrams collected from all the patients' tweets. Pattern of Life Features (PLF) These features reveal the emotional patterns and behavioral tendency of users by measuring polarity emotion and social interactions. In order to fully compose the PLF we combined the following list of features: Age and Gender: Twitter does not publicly provide information about the age and gender of its users mainly due to privacy concerns so we adopted the work of Sap et al. [5] to fill in this information. Polarity Features: The Sentiment140 API 3 was used to label each tweet as either positive negative or neutral. The polarity is furthermore transformed into five different values to capture the affective traits of each user: 1) Positive Ratio: the percentage of positive tweets 2) Negative Ratio: the percentage of negative tweets 3) Positive Combo: captures the mania and hypomania traits of patients which is determined by the number of continuous positive posts appearing more than x amount of times within a period of time in minutes T. 4) Negative Combos: captures the depression traits of patients and is determined by the number of continuous negative posts appearing more than x amount of times within a period of time in minutes T. 5) Flips Ratio: quantifies the emotional unstableness and is determined by counting how frequently two continuous tweets with different polarity (either positive to negative or negative to positive) appear together within a period of time in minutes T. In our work x is set to 2 and T is set to 30 minutes. Social Features: These features can demonstrate how users are behaving with respect to their environment. The following are the social features designed for each user: 1) Tweeting Frequency; the frequency of daily posts; 2) Mention Ratio: the percentage of posts which contain at least one mention of another user; 3) Frequent Mentions: the number of Twitter users mentioned more than three times which is a measurement of how many close friends a particular user may have; 4) Unique Mentions: the number of unique users mentioned which is a measure of the width of a user's social network.,,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,A deep learning model for detecting mental illness from user content on social media,Classification Models,2,We developed six binary classification models each of which categorizes a user’ specific post into one of the following subreddits: r/depression r/Anxiety r/bipolar r/BPD r/schizophrenia and r/autism. Our conjecture is that a user who suffers from a specific mental problem writes a post on the corresponding subreddit that deals with the problem. A user can write posts across multiple subreddits if he/she suffers from multiple mental health problems e.g. a user suffering from both depression and anxiety. However if the model is trained with the posts of users who have multiple symptoms like a prior study10 the classification model may suffer from noisy data. Therefore we developed six independent binary classification models for each symptom to improve the performance. By developing six independent models for each mental disorder each of which uses data where users suffer from only one particular mental problem we were able to accurately identify a user’s potential mental state. For example to develop a model for detecting depression we labeled the posts written by users who upload posts only in the r/depression as the depression class; the opposite class is referred to as the non-depression class. To address a class-imbalance issue for the collected data we applied the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm19. We divided our dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Then XGBoost and convolutional neural network (CNN) were employed. Morover we excluded the posts of users who wrote posts across multiple subreddits in learning phase. To quantitatively represent each post we converted the words in the training set to numerical representations (Fig. 2). For the XGBoost classifier we used the TF-IDF vectorizer in the sckit-learn package20 to convert words into n-dimensional vectors. In the case of the CNN classifier we applied word-embedding procedures from the pre-processed texts using the word2vec API of Python Package Gensim21. The word vectors were pre-trained with the training dataset collected for the current study with continuous bag-of-words representation (CBOW) models while the size of window was set to five. Note that by using the pre-trained word2vec model for representing each post for each subreddit a language style used by users who write posts in a subreddit can be trained for the specific subreddit. An overview of the proposed CNN-based model is presented in Fig. 2. The model architecture is organized by the sequence of layers that includes an embedding layer convolutional layer max-pooling layer dense layers and the output. Fig. 2 illustrates how a post is trained in the given model. The first layer of the model is an embedding layer that represents the word embeddings of a pre-processed post with 20 dimensions and its weight is initialized by the pre-trained word2vec. Second a convolutional layer with input of word vectors has 128 filters and each filter size is five. In addition we applied a dropout rate of 0.25 to prevent over-fitting issues. The next layer is a max-pooling layer which takes the maximum values within the CNN filters and its dimension is 128. The output of the max-pooling layer is passed through two fully connected (dense) layers and the final output is the probability of the classification through the sigmoid activation function which ranges from 0 to 1. For training the neural network we used both the binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer22 with a learning rate of 0.001. Our model was trained through 50 epochs and the batch size was set to 64.,,
https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,Mental Health Surveillance over Social Media with Digital Cohorts,Methodology Building Digital Cohorts Mental Health Classifiers,0,We now briefly describe our approach for cohortbased studies over social media. A more detailed description of the proposed methodology will appear in a forthcoming publication. Most works on social media analysis estimate trends by aggregating document-level signals inferred from arbitrary (and biased) data samples selected to match a predefined outcome. While some recent work has begun incorporating demographic information to contextualize analyses (Mandel et al. 2012; Mitchell et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2017 2019) and to improve representativeness of the data (Coppersmith et al. 2015b; Dos Reis and Culotta 2015) these studies still select on specific outcomes. We depart from these works by constructing a demographically representative digital cohort of social media users prior to the analyses and then conducting cohort-based studies over this preselected population. While a significant undertaking in most medical studies the vast quantities of available social media data make assembling social media cohorts feasible. Such cohorts can be used to support longitudinal and cross-sectional studies allowing experts to contextualize the outcomes produce externally valid trends from inherently biased samples and extrapolate those trends to a broader population. Similar strategies have been utilized in online surveys which can have comparable validity to other survey modalities simply by controlling for basic demographic features such as the location age ethnicity and gender (Duffy et al. 2005).,Our cohort construction process entails two key steps: first randomly selecting a large sample of Twitter users; and second annotating those users with key demographic attributes. While such attributes are not provided by the API automated methods can be used to infer such traits from data (Cesare et al. 2017). Following this approach we develop a demographic inference pipeline to automatically infer age gender race/ethnicity and location for each cohort candidate. Age Identifying age based on the content of a user can be challenging and exact age often cannot be determined based on language use alone. Therefore we use discrete categories that provide a more accurate estimate of age: Teenager (below 19) 20s 30s 40s 50s (50 years or older). Gender The gender was inferred using Demographer a supervised model that predicts the (binary) gender of Twitter users with features based on the name field on the user profile (Knowles et al. 2016). Race/Ethnicity The standard formulation of race and ethnicity is not well understood by the general public so categorizing social media users along these two axes may not be reasonable. Therefore we use a single measure of multicultural expression that includes five categories: White (W) Asian (A) Black (B) Hispanic (H) and Other. Location The location was inferred using Carmen an open-source library for geolocating tweets that uses a series of rules to lookup location strings in a location knowledge-base (Dredze et al. 2013). We use the inferred location to select users that live in the United States. The age and race/ethnicity attributes were inferred with custom supervised classifiers based on Amir et al. (2017)’s user-level model. The classifiers were trained and evaluated on a dataset of 5K annotated users attaining performances of 0.28 and 0.41 Average F1 respectively. See the supplemental notes for additional details on these experiments1 .,We build on prior work on supervised models for mental health inference over social media data. We focus on two mental health conditions — depression and PTSD — and develop classifiers with the self-reported datasets created for CLPysch 2015 (Mitchell et al. 2015; Coppersmith et al. 2015b). These labeled datasets derive from users that have publicly disclosed on Twitter a diagnosis of depression (327 users) or PTSD (246 users) with an equal number of randomly selected demographically-matched (with respect to age and gender) users as controls. For each user the associated metadata and posting history was also collected — up to the 3000 most recent tweets per limitations of the Twitter API. The participants of the task proposed a host of methods ranging from rule-based systems to various supervised models (Pedersen 2015; PreotiucPietro et al. 2015; Coppersmith et al. 2015b). More recently the neural user-level classifier proposed by Amir et al. (2017) showed not only good performance on this task but also the ability to capture implicit similarities between users affected by the same diseases thus opening the door to more interpretable analyses2 . Hence we adopt their model for this analysis.
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67186-4_6,Social Media Mining to Understand Public Mental Health,Topic Modeling,1,First we removed journals with no text and those with fewer than 20 characters1 leaving 1.1 million journals for topic modelling. Next we pre-processed the text using the Stanford Tweet Tokenizer which is a “Twitter-aware” tokenizer designed to handle short informal text [1]. We used the option that truncates characters repeating 3 or more times converting phrases such as “I’m sooooo happyy” to “I’m soo happyy”. On average the number of tokens per journal was 27.7. Since we are interested in topics we removed stopwords and tokens with fewer than two letters and we only retained nouns which appear in the WordNet corpus [10]. After this filtering the average number of nouns per journal was 7. Examples of frequently appearing nouns in alphabetical order include “anxiety” “class” “dinner” “family” “god” “job” “lunch” “miss” “school” “sick” “sleep” and “work”. We then iteratively clustered the journals into topics (details below) and removed nouns that do not refer to topics such as numbers timings (e.g. “today” “yesterday”) general feelings (e.g. “feel” “like”) proper nouns and nouns that have ambiguous meanings (e.g. “overall” “true”). Lastly we only retained nouns that appeared more than ten times in the dataset. This process resulted in a vocabulary of 8386 words for topic modelling. Each journal is represented as a 8386-dimensional term frequency vector with each component denoting the term-frequency/ inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) of the corresponding term. Algorithm 1 summarizes our topic modelling methodology. Given a TF-IDF term frequency vector for each journal we run non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [8] implemented in Python’s scikit-learn package [12]. The objective of NMF is to find two matrices whose product approximates the original matrix. In our case one matrix is the weighted set of topics in each journal and the other is the weighted set of words that belong to each topic. Hence each journal is represented as a combination of topics which are themselves composed of a weighted combination of words. We chose NMF because its non-negativity constraint aids with interpretability. In the context of analyzing word frequencies negative presence of a word would not be interpretable. This is because we only track word occurrences and not semantics or syntax. Unlike other matrix factorization methods NMF reconstructs each document from a sum of positive parts which enables us to easily manually label the discovered topics. Iterating from 4 to 40 topics we derived 37 different topic matrices (steps 1 and 2 of Algorithm 1). Each matrix consists of one topic per row. Each topic has a positive weight for each word in the vocabulary. Stronger weights indicate higher relevance to the topic. The final topic matrix we used has 14 topics and is shown in Table 1. We show the first six words in this table for simplicity where we sorted the words associated with each topic from highest relevance to lowest. When judging the topic matrices we considered the top twenty most important words per topic. Using this information we manually labeled each row in the matrix with a corresponding topic. Furthermore we manually evaluated each matrix based on the distinctness between topics consistency within topics and interpretability. During this process we compiled a custom list of removed words that we mentioned earlier in this section. The groups of words we removed appeared as stand-alone topics that did not offer information about what the journal was about. For example proper nouns appeared as a stand-alone topic. Other words which we deemed too general or ambiguous appeared across several topics and hence did not provide discriminative information. We tested different levels of regularization to enforce sparseness in our models (see [8] for a discussion) but did not find significant differences. However one important modification we made to regularize each topic was to make their first words only as strong as their second ones (by default first words are stronger than second words which are stronger than third words and so on). This is since the most relevant word for each topic tended to be too strong of a signal regardless of how we changed the number of topics pre-processing procedure or regularization in the objective function. For example the word “love” in a journal about sports would be so strong that the journal would be labeled as relating to romantic love. Lowering the importance of first words was sufficient to eliminate the false positives we identified. Given the final topic matrix (summarized in Table 1) the next step is to use it to assign labels to journals (steps 3 and 4 of Algorithm 1). We plotted the distribution of how important each topic was to all journals in the dataset with importance ranging from zero to one. Each distribution had a similar shape with a clear inflection point between 0.05 to 0.15 importance. Figure 4 shows an example importance distribution for the topic “Work” where the inflection point occurs at 0.1 importance.,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557214,Seeking and sharing health information online: comparing search engines and social media,Log Data Collection Search Engine Health Information Seeking and Sharing Survey,2,We focus on the social media platform Twitter a popular microblogging service used by 18% of U.S. Internet users and whose popularity continues to increase [28]. Twitter is particularly interesting to study since nearly all posts are public; the public nature of tweets provides an interesting counterpoint to the private nature of search engine activity. We gathered a 15-month sample of Twitter’s Firehose stream (which includes all public tweets) between November 1 2011 and March 31 2013 made available to us under contract focusing on English-language tweets. Twitter post count and unique user count were computed for each condition and aggregated over the full time period. Specifically we considered a post to belong to a certain health condition if there was a regular expression match of the condition to the text of the post (this would not permit substring matches within terms). To reduce noise we excluded posts that were retweets or contained hyperlinks since they were likely related to general news and not a user’s personal health. Using this method we obtained 125166549 tweets on the 165 health conditions from 62269225 users in the time period of interest. The median number of posts was 51687 per condition from a median of 40152 users per condition.,We mined the logs of a popular search engine over the same 15-month period used in the Twitter analysis focusing on English-language queries. We processed billions of queries from which the queries for the health conditions of interest were extracted. We searched for queries that were either an exact match with one of the symptoms or conditions or those where the condition was some subset of the query terms. As with Twitter substring matches within query terms were not permitted to reduce noise. We also used synonyms of symptoms and conditions to increase coverage. Synonyms were identified via a two-step walk on the search engine click-graph using an approach similar to [2]. Example synonyms for “abdominal pain” included “sore stomach” and “belly ache.” We applied this procedure to all of the conditions. Note that synonyms were not used in the data collection process from Twitter to ensure efficiency by limiting the size of the substring match space (Twitter posts are considerably longer than search queries). We observed 174605024 searches on health conditions from 38676368 users. The median number of searches was 293505 from a median of 85848 users per condition,To gain qualitative insight into people’s health information seeking and sharing practices we conducted an online survey during June 2013 using a recruiting service (Cint) that offers “Census representative sampling” in terms of gender and age throughout regions of the U.S. Respondents were paid approximately 4 USD to complete the survey and were required to have a Twitter account to qualify to participate. The survey comprised 37 questions and took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Participants were asked if they had ever sought health information on a search engine such as Google or Bing or on Twitter and whether they had ever shared health information on Twitter. If they answered affirmatively they were asked to describe the most recent occasion on which they did so including the health condition that motivated them to search or share and their objective in performing the activity. The survey included questions about how often participants used search engines and Twitter for various types of information seeking or sharing views about risks associated with each platform and basic demographics. In total 237 respondents completed the survey. After discarding low quality responses (as determined by nonsensical or sarcastic responses to open questions) 210 valid survey responses were analyzed. Of these respondents 53% were female they resided in 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and 43% had a college degree or higher. Ages ranged from 18 to 70 years (median = 35 years). Respondents reported using search engines frequently (76% at least once per day with only 7% using them less than once per week). 71% of respondents had public Twitter accounts while the remaining 29% had “protected” accounts (i.e. only approved followers could view their postings).
https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/viewPaper/8075,Mental Health Discourse on reddit: Self-Disclosure Social Support and Anonymity,Data and Methods,0,reddit is a social news website where registered users submit content in the form of links or text posts. Users also known as “redditors” can then vote each submission “up” or “down” to rank the post and determine its position or prominence on the site’s pages. These two attributes associated with a post are referred to as “upvotes” and “downvotes”. Redditors can also comment on posts and respond back in a conversation tree of comments. Content entries that is the posts are organized by areas of interest or sub-communities called “subreddits” such as politics programming or science. As of 2013 reddit’s official statistics included 56 billion page views 731 million unique visitors 40855032 posts and 404603286 comments (http://blog.reddit.com/2013/ 12/top-posts-of-2013-stats-and-snoo-years.html). We used of reddit’s official API (http://www.reddit.com/ dev /api) to collect posts comments and associated metadata from several mental health subreddits: specifically using a Python wrapper PRAW (https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/ latest/index.html). The subreddits we crawled were: alcoholism anxiety bipolarreddit depression mentalhealth MMFB (Make Me Feel Better) socialanxiety SuicideWatch. All of these subreddits host public content. In order to arrive at a comprehensive list of subreddits to focus on we utilized reddit’s native subreddit search feature (http://www.reddit.com/reddits) and searched for subreddits on “mental health”. Two researchers familiar with reddit employed an initial filtering step on the search results returned so that we focus on high precision subreddits discussing mental health concerns and issues. Thereafter we focused on a snowball approach in which starting with a few seed subreddits (mentalhealth depression) we compiled a second list of “related” or “similar” subreddits that are listed in the profile pages of the seed subreddits. Following a second filtering step we arrived at the list of subreddits listed above. For each of these subreddits we obtained daily crawls of their posts in the New category. Corresponding to each post we collected information on the title of the post the body or textual content id timestamp when the post was made author id and the number of upvotes and downvotes it obtained. Since posts gather comments over a period of time following the time of sharing we crawled all of the comments per post that were shared over a three day period after the post was made. Qualitative examinations of the subreddits of interest revealed that 90% or more of the comments to any post were typically made in a three day window following the time the post is made—hence the choice. The crawl of the subreddits used in this paper We present some descriptive statistics of our crawled data. Our dataset contained 20411 posts with at least one comment and 97661 comments in all with 27102 unique users who made posts comments or both. A set of 7823 users (28.79%) were found to write both at least one post and comment. CDF of the user distribution over posts and comments is given in Figure 1. The figure shows the expected heavy tail trend observed in several social phenomena. Also see Figure 2 for the distribution of comments over time following post share. It illustrates the quick responsivity culture in the communities we study (peak at 3 hours). Some of the additional statistics of our dataset are given in Table 1. Further example titles of a few,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025932,Modeling and Understanding Visual Attributes of Mental Health Disclosures in Social Media,Data Reliability,0,Next we assessed the suitability and reliability of our collected corpus of Instagram posts and users for our later analyses. For the purpose we extracted n-grams (n=3) from the profile biographies of users. The top 10 uni- bi- and trigrams are shown in Table 3. They show that users are appropriating Instagram to seek and provide social and emotional support around different mental health concerns (“need someone talk” “feel free dm”). There are also explicit mentions of specific psychological challenges around mental health (“depression anxiety” “telling suicidal kids”) including warnings for profile visitors (“trigger warning”) and personal experiences of the condition (“alone alone alone”). We corroborated these observations with a licensed psychiatrist and concluded that the users in our dataset are engaging in genuine mental health disclosures tend to demonstrate disinhibition towards sharing their mental health experiences and are appropriating the platform specifically for this purpose via the chosen account.,,
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300996,A content analysis of depression-related tweets,Tweets Related to Depression,0,Tweets about depression were collected by Simply Measured a company that specializes in social media measurement and analytics (Simply Measured 2014). Simply Measured has access to the Twitter “firehose” (or full volume of tweets) via Gnip a licensed company that can retrieve the full Twitter data stream. All tweets in the English language that contained at least either “depressed” “#depressed” “depression” or “#depression” were collected between April 11 and May 4 2014. We scanned a random sample of the tweets to identify common phrases that included our keywords of interest but were not about mental health. In SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC) we used the index function which searches a character expression (in this case the text of the tweet) for a specific string of characters to locate and remove such tweets from our sample. We removed tweets that included the following terms regardless of capitalization: “Great Depression” “economic depression” “during the depression” “depression era” “tropical depression” and “depressed real estate”. The popularity and influence of the Tweeters was described using the distribution of followers and Klout Scores. While number of followers is a measure of popularity Klout Score is a measure of influence. Klout Scores range from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating higher influence. Klout Score is calculated based on an algorithm that considers over 400 signals from eight different online networks. Examples of signals include the amount of retweets a person generates in relation to the amount of tweets shared and the amount of engagement a user drives from unique individuals (e.g. lots of retweets from different individuals as opposed to lots of retweets from one person) (Klout Inc. 2014).,,
https://aclanthology.org/W15-1202.pdf,Quantifying the Language of Schizophrenia in Social Media,Data,2,We follow the data acquisition and curation process of Coppersmith et al. (2014a) summarizing the major points here: Social media such as Twitter contains frequent public statements by users reporting diagnoses for various medical conditions. Many talk about physical health conditions (e.g. cancer flu) but some also discuss mental illness including schizophrenia. There are a variety of motivations for users to share this information on social media: to offer or seek support to fight the stigma of mental illness or perhaps to offer an explanation for certain behaviors.4 We obtain messages with these self-reported diagnoses using the Twitter API and filtered via (caseinsensitive) regular expression to require “schizo” or a close phonetic approximation to be present; our expression matched “schizophrenia” its subtypes and various approximations: “schizo” “skitzo” “skitso” “schizotypal” “schizoid” etc. All data we collect are public posts made between 2008 and 2015 and exclude any message marked as ‘private’ by the author. All use of the data reported in this paper has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB). Each self-stated diagnosis included in this study was examined by a human annotator (one of the authors) to verify that it appeared to be a genuine statement of a schizophrenia diagnosis excluding jokes quotes or disingenuous statements. We obtained 174 users with an apparently genuine selfstated diagnosis of a schizophrenia-related condition. Note that we cannot be certain that the Twitter user was actually diagnosed with schizophrenia only that their statement of being diagnosed appears to be genuine. Previous work indicates that interannotator agreement for this task is good: κ = 0.77 (Coppersmith et al. 2014a). For each user we obtained a set of their public Twitter posts via the Twitter API collecting up to 3200 tweets.5 As we wish to focus on user-authored content we exclude from analysis all retweets and any tweets that contain a URL (which often contain text that the user did not author). We lowercase all words and convert any non-standard characters (including emoji) to a systematic ASCII representation via Unidecode.6 For our community controls we used randomlyselected Twitter users who primarily tweet in English. Specifically during a two week period in early 2014 each Twitter user who was included in Twitter’s 1% “spritzer” sample had an equal chance for inclusion in our pool of community controls. We then collected some of their historic tweets and assessed the language(s) they tweeted in according to the Chromium Compact Language Detector.7 Users were excluded from our community controls if their tweets were less than 75% English.8,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2700171.2791026,Detecting Changes in Suicide Content Manifested in Social Media Following Celebrity Suicides,Wikipedia Data Social Media Data,0,Next we compiled a list of reported celebrity suicides which fell within the time range of our Reddit data. Defining who is a “celebrity” is nontrivial so we refer to the Wikipedia page listing celebrity suicides7 as a way to measure who has sufficient celebrity status for inclusion. We obtained 10 reported celebrity suicides in the same period as our Reddit data; their names and reported suicides are shown in Table 2. We measure the prominence of a celebrity’s death by measuring the change in Wikipedia page views for the celebrity’s Wikipedia page. Wikipedia provides daily page view statistics for each page.8 We compare the number of page-views in the two weeks prior to their death with the two weeks following their death in terms of z-score (Figure 1). Here z-scores are computed by converting the page views to standard normal variable with 0-mean and standard deviation of 1. For 9/10 of the cases we see a notable spike in number of views showing that the suicides of these individuals were well-known enough to be viewable on such a macro scale and for examining the presence of Werther Effect in social media. We note two aspects related to the above analysis and which will be used through the rest of this paper. First since we are focusing on different types of data sources—Wikipedia and Reddit we use z-score conversion as a normalization technique for the Wikipedia page views and Reddit’s SW posting activity volume. Further the above observation in Wikipedia data and the analyses that ensue focus on observing changes over a two week window preceding and succeeding a celebrity suicide; this choice is motivated by our initial analyses and from the literature on Werther Effect [17].,As mentioned earlier we examine data from Reddit. We provide a description of the features of this social media platform which are important to understand the context of our research problem. Reddit allows users to submit content in the form of links or text posts organized by areas of interest or sub-communities called “subreddits” (e.g. politics programming science). Users can voice their opinion on the post via a voting mechanism which allows more popular submissions to be featured more prominently according to their score: the difference between the “upvotes” and “downvotes” cast on each post (also known as “score”). Users can also engage with each other via a comment thread attached to each post. In 2014 Reddit had 71 billion page views over 8 000 active communities 55 million posts and 535 million comments5 . In this paper we focus specifically on the subreddit called “SuicideWatch” a forum for users contemplating suicide and who seek help advice and support. It is a strong support community with (currently) about 35K subscribers. The community is highly moderated with many of its moderators and active subscribers adopting prominent roles in providing support to individuals showing vulnerability. In this subreddit votes on posts are used as a proxy for support and to increase or decrease a post’s prominence rather than as a statement of agreement/disagreement. We used Reddit’s official API6 to collect posts comments and associated metadata from r/SuicideWatch (hereafter SW). Our analysis in this paper is based on all posts made to SW between October 16 2013 and December 19 2014 – 66059 posts from 19159 unique users. Example (paraphrased) titles of posts from r/SuicideWatch are given in Table 1. We collected the title of the post the body or textual content ID timestamp author ID the number of upvotes and downvotes the post obtained including the difference between upvotes and downvotes on the post (i.e. score.),
https://aclanthology.org/W17-3110.pdf,Small but Mighty: Affective Micropatterns for Quantifying Mental Health from Social Media Language,Data,0,We briefly explain the data collection method here but we refer the interested reader with further questions on the methodology to Coppersmith et al. (2016) for the suicide attempt data and Coppersmith et al. (2014a) for all other conditions. The data for these analyses are Twitter posts collected via two methods. Most of the data come from users who have publicly discussed their mental health conditions. These users are frequently referred to as “self-stated diagnosis” users as they state publicly something like “I was diagnosed with schizophrenia” or “I’m so thankful to have survived my suicide attempt last year”. The data for users with a suicide attempt was supplemented by data from OurDataHelps.org a data donation site where people provide access to their public posts and fill out a short questionnaire about their mental health history. Data are then deidentified and made available to researchers addressing questions of interest to the mental health community. Donors provide consent for their data to be used in mental health research upon signup. Of the users who attempted suicide 146 came from OurDataHelps.org. Specifically we examine generalized anxiety disorder eating disorders panic attacks schizophrenia and attempted suicides. These conditions were selected based on the theory that there are important timing aspects to their symptoms – ebbing and flowing of symptoms as treatment is effective (especially schizophrenia) onset and exacerbation of symptoms by external events and stress and punctuated events in time of psychological symptoms (suicide attempts panic attacks and binging/purging behavior with eating disorders). We use the Twitter streaming API to collect a sample of users who used a series of mental health words or phrases in their tweet text (e.g. ‘schizophrenia‘ or ‘suicide attempt‘). Each tweet that uses one of these phrases is examined via regular expression to indicate that the user is talking about themselves. Finally those tweets that pass the regular expression are examined by a human to confirm (to the best of our ability) that their selfstatement of diagnosis appears to be genuine. This results in a dataset with users that have a self-stated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2408) an eating disorder (749) panic attacks (263) schizophrenia (350) or someone who would go on to attempt suicide (423). Some of these users do not exhibit the sort of posting behavior required to create micropatterns (i.e. they rarely post multiple times within a 3 hour time window). We exclude these users from our analysis which is 5-9% of users for most conditions with the exception of those with a suicide attempt where a little over half the users do not exhibit this posting behavior. The resultant dataset used for analyses is: generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2271) eating disorders (687) panic attacks (247) schizophrenia (318) suicide attempts (157). In order to allow comparisons of each condition to control users we gather a random sample of 10000 Twitter users for whom at least 75% of their posts are identified by Twitter as English. All the users with a self-stated diagnoses and all members of this control population have their age and gender estimated according to Sap et al. (2014). For each user with a self-stated diagnosis we find a matched control through the following procedure: create a pool of users where the estimated gender matches and the estimated age is within the same 10-year bracket (the suggested accuracy of the age estimator). From that pool of age- and gender- matched users we select the user whose tweets start and end over the most similar timeframe. We will refer to these age- gender- and time-matched controls simply as “matched controls” throughout the rest of this paper. All tweets were publicly posted by their author (i.e. no users marked at “protected” or “private” were included). On average users had 2949 tweets. The distribution of estimated age and genders for users with each self-stated condition can be seen in Figure 1. For most conditions the population skews female though for schizophrenia the genders are roughly balanced. The average age tends to be in the early-to-mid 20s.,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2998181.2998220,Gender and Cross-Cultural Differences in Social Media Disclosures of Mental Illness,Obtaining Genuine Mental Health Disclosures,2,We note that the candidate mental health disclosure data sample is prone to significant noise. It is possible that although a user uses one of the mental health keyphrases in their Twitter post it may not indicate a genuine disclosure (e.g. “when I have to wake up at 6am I feel like killing myself” does not indicate a person’s real intention of taking their life). To eliminate such users we adopt a semi-supervised machine learning method [58] in which we compare the language of each user in our Twitter dataset with the language of a selfidentified set of social media users suffering a from mental illness. For the purpose we obtain a large sample of 79833 posts from 44262 users made on the Reddit subcommunities r/depression r/mentalhealth and r/SuicideWatch between February and November 2014. We use this dataset a weak signal of the language used by individuals identifying with a form of mental illness. Prior work has also indicated that the disclosures made on these forums are genuine disclosures of mental illnesses and have also been validated through consultation with a psychiatrist [16]. Our approach proceeds as follows: Step 1. We create Twitter user-centric vector-representations by collating all of their posts – this would give us as many vectors as the number of users in the candidate disclosure sample. We also similarly create a single vector representation by collating all posts in our Reddit dataset. Step 2. Next we establish comparative validity across the Twitter vectors and the Reddit vector. This is an important step because the language of Twitter and Reddit cannot be directly compared due to the unique affordances of each site and the seeming differences in the demographics of the two7 . For each of these vectors we perform linguistic normalization of tokenized items in them8 . Then we compute the average automated readability index (ARI [44]) on all of the normalized Twitter vectors and the Reddit vector. We observe the ARI differential between the two to be ∼6.7%9  indicating that the languages are close to standardized internet speak [25] and hence comparable following normalization. Step 3. Next we build n-gram language models (n = 3) for both the normalized Twitter vectors and the single Reddit vector. We then determine cosine similarity scores between the language models of each normalized Twitter vector and the Reddit vector. Step 4. Finally we obtain the distribution of cosine similarities over all normalized Twitter vectors (see Figure 1(a)). We construct the “genuine disclosure dataset” of users to be those vectors (of users) for whom the cosine similarity of their language models with that of Reddit’s is greater than or equal to the median similarity across all vectors (median distance=.71 σ = .157). Our final dataset of genuine mental illness disclosures consisted of 231611 users; we will refer to this set as the MID users.,,
https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e14199/,Detecting Signs of Depression in Tweets in Spanish: Behavioral and Linguistic Analysis,Data Collection and User Selection,1,The selection of the tweets and their users was based on the filtered real-time streaming support provided by the Twitter API. In the first step we selected the users who showed potential signs of depression on Twitter on the basis of the 20 most frequent words in Spanish expressed by patients suffering from depression in clinical settings. These words were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general features of depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [42]. The list of words used and their English translations are shown in Textbox 1. During June 2018 1470000 tweets including 1 or more occurrences of the words listed in Textbox 1 were collected. From this collection of tweets and to select the users who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile descriptions including 1 or more occurrences of the word “depr” and all the possible derivations related to the word depression in Spanish such as “depre” “depresión” “depresivo” “depresiva” “deprimido” and “deprimida” were considered. From the 720 users who included 1 or more of these words in their description profile 90 users who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis. This selection was performed by a psychologist verifying that the statements were related to real expressions of depression excluding quotes jokes or fake ones. For each of these depressed Twitter users we collected all the most recent tweets from their timeline up to a maximum of about 3200 tweets. Thus a total of 189669 tweets were collected a figure that was reduced to 140946 after discarding the retweets. These 140946 tweets constituted the depressive users dataset. Examples of sentences appearing in the user profiles that were used for selecting the depressive users are: “Paciente psiquiátrico con depresión crónica” (Psychiatric patient with chronic depression; example of a profile sentence that indicates depression). “Colecciono errores traducidos a tweets depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor” (I gather errors translated into depressing tweets and into one or another love impulse; example of a profile sentence that does not indicate depression). Once the users with profile sentences indicating depression had been retrieved their Twitter timelines were collected. Only those users having in their timeline at least 10 tweets that suggested signs of depression were retained for further analyses. For each user the selection of these tweets was performed by manually inspecting the tweets of the user’s complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by means of the Twitter API . Finally a total number of 1000 tweets issued by the 90 depressive users suggesting signs of depression were detected and used for the analysis. This set of tweets provided us with the depressive tweets dataset which was used to analyze linguistic features of tweets showing signs of depression. It has to be mentioned that these 1000 tweets were not to be included in the depressive users dataset (see Figure 1). At the same time more than 97500000 tweets were also collected in June 2018: such tweets were gathered by listening to the public Twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweets with Spanish textual contents (as detected by Twitter language identification support). Given that Twitter requires more restrictive filters than just the language of the tweets we used a list of the most frequently used Spanish words (stopwords) to retrieve all tweets that included 1 or more of these words. The vast majority of Spanish tweets should match this criterion. A sample of 450 users who did not mention in their profile the word depression and its derivations were selected randomly from the 97500000 tweets. The complete timelines of these users were compiled (1141021 tweets) which were reduced to 712589 once retweets were removed. These 712589 tweets constituted the control dataset. To identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by Twitter for each tweet selecting tweets in Spanish. It has to be noted that these data can contain some tweets from unidentified depressive users.,,
https://aclanthology.org/W18-0608.pdf,Cross-cultural differences in language markers of depression online,Data Collection  ,0,Data was collected from 7 Cups of Tea an anonymous online chat-based peer support community for emotional distress1 . Users agree at signup that their data may be used for the purposes of research. All the data used for the current study was anonymous and securely stored. This research was performed in line with the ethical and privacy protocols outlined in detail in (Benton et al. 2017). Data from 7 Cups takes the form of written dialogue between users of the service and volunteers who are trained as “active listeners”. A fragment of an exchange between the user of the service (U) and the volunteer (V) might go as follows: For the analyses reported in this paper we used only text generated by users of the service not the volunteers providing peer support. Users who reported depression as their primary concern at sign up were eligible for inclusion in analyses. Our original sample was comprised of 23048 conversations involving 1937 unique users. Users were excluded from the sample if they did not indicate their culture or if they selected ‘Other’. This resulted in the exclusion of 199 and 130 users respectively. The original sample also included users identifying as Native American or American Indian. This group was excluded from analyses since the majority of the data among these users was not English. This resulted in the removal of 15 users leaving a total sample size of 1593.,,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359169,Cross-Cultural Differences in the Use of Online Mental Health Support Forums,Method of Analysis,0,"Selection Criteria and Data Scope. To understand the impact of cultural differences on how individuals use online mental health platforms we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of users from different national communities on Talklife a support platform with over half a million users [91]. For this analysis due to the fact that most research in CSCW on mental health online has been done either agnostic of cultural context [12 34] or in a Western context [60 67 88] we choose to focus on users from non-Western countries following Zhang et al. [103]. As researchers located in the Global South and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory models [52] of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of CSCW and CSCWadjacent mental health research away from the West is crucial to better meet the needs of people often underserved by the medical system [70]. To create these subgroups of users we choose the three non-Western countries with the highest user populations on Talklife or India Malaysia and the Philippines. Guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuances to mental health expression for each country [35 62 77 80] we examine the national identity linguistic and behavior-based differences of use between each user subgroup. In particular this research notes that as a result of cultural norms around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualizations of mental illness in India Malaysia and the Philippines symptoms are often expressed in somatic and religious terms as opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric terms. We choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reasons. On a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity has commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity [31 33 52]. Additionally on a more practical level each user’s country was determined using their IP address by Talklife and shared with us in an user-anonymized dataset. Inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity as discussed in past work [47] and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural differences than analysis at the national level. We analyze data from 10532 Indian users 3370 Malaysian users and 3370 Filipino users as shown in Table 2. Collectively we refer to these countries as the minority sample. As a comparison set we construct a random sample of all threads on Talklife and refer to it as the majority sample. Due to the relative prevalence of users from Western English-speaking countries in Talklife most of the threads in the majority sample include posts from countries such as the USA UK and Canada. Indians are the largest non-Western minority subgroup on Talklife. Data was sampled from May 2012 to June 2018. Following this cross-national analysis to see if our broader results on Talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest Western country (the United States) and the largest non-Western country (India) represented on 7Cups a similar support platform with more than 15000 users actively using the platform each week [7]. Using 7Cups data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural differences we found in our Talklife sample. For this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from 6055 Indian users and 18581 American users as shown in Table 2. Unlike our sample of Talklife users this dataset is not a random sample. There is an upsampling of Indian users to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of Indians in the dataset. Like on Talklife Indians are the largest non-Western minority subgroup on 7Cups. We focus on Indian users due to a lack of sufficient data on users from Malaysia or the Philippines. Data was sampled from March 2014 - August 2018. 3.1.2 Defining Cultural Identity and Use of Clinical Language. In this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forums. To do so we leverage Tomlinson’s definition of cultural identity as “self and communal definitions based around specific usually politically inflected differentiations: gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality"" [94] particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that runs along national lines as delineated by Hall et al. [41]. As a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other forms of identity including religious or ethnic identity. However in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity as a proxy for cultural identity. Additionally following Schlesinger et al’s [83] call for more intersectional analyses and methods within HCI we also include analyses of adjacent and intersecting identities when relevant including religious identity. To analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnoses. Following methods used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language [30] we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigrams and trigrams from a list of mental disorders as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [100]. We also included all unigrams from the MacMillan Dictionary list of words used to describe illnesses and diseases both specifically for mental illness and general illness [1–3]. As a result we include unigrams like “night"" (from night terrors) or sleep (from “sleep disorder"") as these are often correlated with specific symptoms of mental illness or distress such as sleep issues or being awake at night [30]. This included any clinically common abbreviations for mental disorders such as OCD for “obsessive compulsive disorder"" or BPD for “borderline personality disorder."" Shorthand for disorders commonly used by online communities such as “pro-ana” (as used in pro-eating disorder communities) [22] were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these terms across disorders. We choose to use terms from and associated with DSM and ICD categorized disorders as a result of the common usage of these frameworks globally [99]. Throughout our analysis of these varied factors we use µ to represent means and σ to represent standard deviations. 3.1.3 Constraints Limitations and Tradeoffs. Cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting levels including subcultures and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity. As a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraints in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis. One large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level as a proxy for cultural identity. Though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity as argued by both Hall [41] and Tomlinson [94] each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identities that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity [54 64 89]. A more rich analysis of these other forms of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusions about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support communities particularly with regard to cultural differences between users with the same national identity. Additionally to stay consistent between analyses as a result of a lack of data on users from Malaysia and the Philippines we only analyze users in India on 7Cups and extend these findings to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum. We draw validity for these exploratory findings from similar consistent patterns we observe between Indian Malaysian and Filipino users but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority communities these conclusions do not hold true. Additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used DSM and ICD both frameworks of illness categorization have significant limitations particularly in the countries we have selected. For example there are both mental health disorders that are culturebound [74] as well as mental health language that is used in different ways within the specific countries we analyze such as depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illnesses [53]. Additionally it is clear that online support communities often develop their own cultural norms and language around mental health [21 72] and a deeper understanding of how this plays out on Talklife and 7Cups is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work. In this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical terms for mental health disorders in our analysis of clinical language. As detailed in past anthropological research [52] it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across cultures as a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder as opposed to conceptualizing distress as “stress"" “tension"" or “depression"" [25 53 98]. For our analysis we strictly analyzed posts that were in the Latin alphabet with almost all posts on both Talklife and 7Cups being in English. However as both Malay [8] and Tagalog [82] are most commonly written in the Latin script and since it is common for users from India speakers to use romanized versions of Indian languages online [79] it is possible that a small minority of posts in our analysis were text in a different language. However as confirmed by only seeing English words used in our analysis of the top n-grams among each user subgroup it is clear that English is the predominant language on both platforms. Though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of non-English code-switching on these platforms could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interactions on expression between users with the same national identity but different language preferences.",,

Researchers interested in the code and the data are invited to contact the authors. Reddit is a website which enables users to aggregate rate and discuss news entertainment politics and many other topics. According to Alexa it is the 8th most popular website in the world. It was estimated by the Pew research center that 6% of online adults use Reddit [26]. The site is organized into a collection of “subreddits” each focused on a particular topic and administered by a collection of moderators. The subreddit r/SuicideWatch is a forum in which online users are encouraged to post their thoughts regarding suicide. At the time of our data collection it had over 58000 subscribers. Sometimes users express a preoccupation with the thought of suicide. Other times users discuss immediate plans to take their own life. These posts often contain a description of their mental state including depression reaction to stress their feelings of being alone and having a low self-esteem. While most online sources of data are notoriously noisy this particular subreddit is remarkably clean. Given the serious nature of the subreddit individuals are less likely to post harassing comments or off-topic remarks. When users post such comments the moderators of the subreddit quickly remove them. We collected all posts from its inception in 2008 to 2016. Each post is often commented on by other individuals. In this work we focused on the original post as it most often represents the suicidal ideation of a user and comments often represent emotional support from other users. We cleaned this data. First we removed empty posts in which the content had been deleted. Second we removed links and replaced them with the word “link”. Third we concatenated the text of the post to the title as many users begin their post in the title and continue in the body of the post. Finally we removed punctuation and other special characters. After cleaning this data we had 131728 posts with 27978246 words of which 84607 words were unique posted by 63252 unique users.,,
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8609647,Online Social Networks in Health Care: A Study of Mental Disorders on Reddit,Dataset,0,Reddit is a multilingual Online Social Network founded in 2005 and organized in subcommunities by areas of interest called subreddits. We obtained data from the Reddit's data repository4 focusing on four subreddits where people discuss issues related to mental heath disorders: Depression (/r/depression) Suicide Watch (/r/Suicide Watch) Anxiety (/r/anxiety) and Bipolar (/r/bipolar). Our dataset is comprised of user activities (posts and comments) that took place between 2011 and 201 7. Here we focus on data from January 2017 to December 2017. In total we obtained 261511 posts and 1256669 comments from 184708 unique users. Table I shows the total number of users posts and comments per subreddit. The total number of comments in each community is at least 4.2 times larger than the number of posts which suggests a supportive behavior among users.,,
