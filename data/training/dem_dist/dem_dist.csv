Separate surveys were created for depressed and healthy individuals. In the depressed survey participants were invited to complete a survey that involved passing a series of inclusion criteria responding to a standardized clinical depression survey answering questions related to demographics and history of depression and sharing social media history. We used the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) questionnaire to screen participant depression levels []. CES-D assessment quality has been demonstrated as on-par with other depression inventories including the Beck Depression Inventory and the Kellner Symptom Questionnaire [ ]. Healthy participants were screened to ensure no history of depression and active Instagram use. See Additional file  for actual survey text. Qualified participants were asked to share their Instagram usernames and history. An app embedded in the survey allowed participants to securely log into their Instagram accounts and agree to share their data.b Upon securing consent we made a one-time collection of participants’ entire Instagram posting history. In total we collected  photographs from  Instagram users  of whom had a history of depression. We asked a different set of MTurk crowdworkers to rate the Instagram photographs collected. This new task asked participants to rate a random selection of  photos from the data we collected. Raters were asked to judge how interesting likable happy and sad each photo seemed on a continuous - scale. Each photo was rated by at least three different raters and ratings were averaged across raters. Raters were not informed that photos were from Instagram nor were they given any information about the study participants who provided the photos including mental health status. Each ratings category showed good inter-rater agreement. Only a subset of participant Instagram photos were rated (N = ). We limited ratings data to a subset because this task was time-consuming for crowdworkers and so proved a costly form of data collection. For the depressed sample ratings were only made for photos posted within a year in either direction of the date of first depression diagnosis. Within this subset for each user the nearest  posts prior to the diagnosis date were rated. For the control population the most recent  photos from each user’s date of participation in this study were rated.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858207 ,Discovering Shifts to Suicidal Ideation from Mental Health Content in Social Media,Constructing User Classes,0,We split our data into two sequential time periods (t1 from Feb 11 2014 to Aug 11 2014 and t2 from Aug 12 2014 to November 11 2014). Using these two time periods we created two sets of users. Note that since Reddit does not enforce the real name rule of having exactly one account per person our reference to “users” in this paper is equivalent to “user accounts”. First we identified those users that posted on MHs during t1 but did not post on SW during t1 or t2 (i.e. users that discuss mental health topics but not on SW; hereafter “MH”). The second class included those who posted on MHs during t1 and posted in SW during t2 (i.e. users that discuss mental health topics originally not related to suicide but eventually transition to talk about suicide; hereafter “MH → SW”). Figure 1 shows a schematic description of our user class construction. Note that by focusing on users that initiate at least one post on SW or the MHs as opposed to only commenting we can focus on those frequenting the communities for support disregarding those primarily providing help through commentary. This split yielded 440 MH → SW users; which is 1.52% of the total number of 28831 accounts who posted in MHs but never on SW during either of the periods. To construct a MH cohort of equal size who did not post on SW in either period we randomly sampled a set of 440 users from the 28831 users. Note although MH users did not post on SW during our timeframe of analysis they may have done so outside the bounds of our analysis. To support our goal of characterizing differences between the MH → SW and MH users we obtained via Reddit’s API the timeline of posts and comments authored by the 880 users (the API only provides the last 1000 public posts and comments for a user). For each post we obtained their associated metadata (e.g. vote difference or score) and comments. Our final dataset contained 4731 posts and 46949 comments from the 440 MH → SW users and 8318 posts and 54086 comments from the 440 MH users We note an important concern: individuals may post suicidal thoughts on MHs never engaging on SW and thus “corrupting” the MHs data with discussions of suicidal ideation. We argue against this possibility. (1) SW is a prominent suicide support forum and the role of this community in suicide prevention and in acting as an inoculator of vulnerable thoughts is well-recognized [31]. (2) Most MHs (e.g.r/depression) clearly specify in their guidelines that suicidal thoughts should go to SW: “It’s usually better to post anything that specifically involves suicidal thoughts or intent in /r/SuicideWatch rather than here. If you’re concerned about someone else who may be at risk for suicide please check out their talking tips and risk assessment guide.” (3) Finally discussions with the moderators of SW confirmed that active steps are taken to move all suicidal ideation related content to SW. Given these considerations we expect that few suicidal ideation posts appear on subreddits outside of SW.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702613.2732733,Detecting and Characterizing Mental Health Related Self-Disclosure in Social Media,Self-Disclosure Inference,0,Based on the training data thus created we pursued the use of supervised learning to develop a classifier which would indicate whether a post is of high low or no self-disclosure. We tested a variety of different classification techniques (decision trees k Nearest Neighbor naive Bayes). The best performing classifier was found to be a perceptron classifier with adaptive boosting used to amplify performance [17] whose results will be used in the remainder of this paper. We used the following feature generation rules: First we eliminated stopwords from each post based on standard list provided by Python’s NLTK library. Next we performed stemming using Porter Stemmer. We extracted uni- bi- and tri-grams from each post and considered those with five or more occurrences. We also computed two additional features – length of each post and whether the author of the post is an exclusive poster on mental health forums or is observed in our dataset to post on other forums as well. Thus each post was characterized by 1070 features. We used standard 10-fold cross validation (CV) to evaluate the classifier and ran our model over 100 random 10-fold CV assignments for generalizability of the results. We report the average accuracy precision recall F1 specificity as metrics of performance. We find that our classifier based on the perception model yields an average accuracy of 78.4% in detecting high or low self-disclosure with .74 precision and .86 recall (see Table 4 for details). Other methods like k-NN (k=5) give higher precision but at the expense of very low recall. Figure 1 gives the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves for all the models. Per the ROC curve corresponding to the perceptron model we find it to yield the maximum area under curve (.81) hence best performance. We further identify in Table 5 the n-grams (or features) with the highest weights given by the perceptron – it implies these features were the most significant in the classification task. We provide some brief qualitative examinations of these n-grams in the light of prior psychology literature on selfdisclosure and mental health [10 11]. We find that the ngrams primarily are associated with vulnerable and selfloathing thoughts (e.g. thoughts of suicide) bear a negative tone or depict confessional experiences. Based on prior research [10 11 12] and our own work on mental health discourse on Reddit [4] we find that these are the topical dimensions along which high self-disclosure and low/no selfdisclosure posts vary. In essence high self-disclosure posts share extensively their personal beliefs and fear for instance their vital constructs and private sensitive informational attributes. The post excerpts below have been classified to be of high self-disclosure and through them we demonstrate the use of some of the n-grams in Table 7: \“I don’t want to kill myself I haven’t felt suicidal in a long time but I just want to stop life for a while you know?” “My dad would beat the living shit out of me […]. I’ve been to the hospital so many times I’ve lost track” “I hate this. I hate myself. I don't want to f****** be this person anymore. I'm unmotivated unfocused immature.”,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702280,Recognizing Depression from Twitter Activity,Data Gathering Characterizing Discourse Via Self Disclosure,2,In this study we gathered information on depression levels of Twitter users and their activity histories. To do this we published a website to administer a questionnaire and disseminated information about the website over Twitter1. In contrast to De Choudhury et al. [14] who collected data from Englishspeaking users through crowdsourcing this study collected data from Japanese-speaking volunteers. This approach was used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research [14]. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of our website. The website collected the responses to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the Twitter users who participated (hereinafter the participants) and to collect the histories of participants activities on Twitter. The activity histories of participants were collected through the Twitter application programming interface (API)2 and the questionnaires to determine degree of depression were completed by participants through their web browsers. Before data collection visitors to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aims of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled. Those who consented to become participants after receiving the explanation logged into their individual Twitter accounts through the OAuth authorization process. Next participants were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression. A message called the “kokoro score” (“kokoro” is a Japanese word meaning “heart”) determined on the basis of answers to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweets was displayed to participants after completion of the questionnaire (Fig. 2). Experiment participants were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over Twitter by word-of-mouth in a type of snowball sampling. The CES-D questionnaire was used to evaluate the degree of depression [30]. In the CES-D test participants answered 20 questions on a Likert-type 4-point scale. Each answer was assigned a score of 0-3 points with the sum of the points from all answers used as the score to estimate likelihood of depression. Several standards exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression. In this research we regarded a score of 22 points or higher as indicating active depression and a score of 21 points or lower as indicating no active depression; these are the same values as used in [14] and give a cutoff score of 22. In addition answers to BDI [2] a depression scale used with characteristics similar to CESD were collected to ensure the reliability of data. For each participant scores were calculated on both scales with poor correlation regarded as indicating unreliable answers. The time taken to answer the questionnaires was also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded. After each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on Twitter was collected from Twitter by using the API. At most 3200 tweets were collected for each participant and the number of users following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded. Tweets published after the questionnaire was taken were discarded. The website was opened to the public on 4 December 2013 at which time the authors publicized it on their Twitter accounts. Between 4 December 2013 and 8 February 2014 219 people participated in the experiment. After eliminating participants who did not tweet and participants who answered the questionnaire in fewer than 30 seconds (as previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answers) 214 sets of answers remained. Only the first set of answers was used for participants who completed the questionnaire more than once. As a result data about 209 experiment participants (male: 121; female: 88) aged 16 to 55 (mean: 28.8 years; standard deviation: 8.2 years) were analyzed. The correlations between CES-D score and BDI score for these participants were high 0.87 and there were no participants with uncorrelated scores so the data for all 209 participants were used; excluded datasets are not discussed any further. Figure 3 shows the histogram of CES-D scores of 209 participants. Among the participants 81 (resp. 128) were estimated to have (resp. not have) active depression for an incidence of approximately 39%. This incidence is similar to that found by De Choudhury et al. [14] who identified depression in approximately 36% of participants. Table 1 gives statistics on the activity histories of participants.,Following the development of the self-disclosure classifier we wanted to apply it on an unlabeled set of mental health posts in order to study how levels of self-disclosure characterize the nature of discourse and community response on these Reddit forums. For the purpose we used the unlabeled 4.1M mental health forum posts obtained by crawling the histories of those users in mental health forums who posted five or more times in our observed data. On applying our trained self-disclosure classifier on these 4.1M posts we find that 1.9M posts were classified as high self-disclosure posts 1.3M posts were categorized to be of low self-disclosure while .9M were assigned to be having no self-disclosure. This indicates that in general mental health communities on Reddit are characterized by high selfdisclosure in the shared content. Presumably individuals find these forums to be an open platform that allows expressing views and thoughts about a topic often considered to be sensitive or unacceptable to the mainstream. The ability to be fairly anonymous on Reddit perhaps facilitates such high self-disclosure – unlike Facebook a user does not need to specify any personal information in their profiles (e.g. location age name gender etc.). We further observe from Figure 2 that majority of the users who self-disclose more tend to also have longer tenure on Reddit. By tenure here we mean the total amount of time (in months) the user has been observed to be active on Reddit based on our dataset. Most low self-disclosure users have shorter tenure relatively the same is true for the bulk of the no self-disclosure users (F= 6.2; p<.01 based on KruskalWallis test). This shows that users find the ability to selfdisclose more to be helpful resulting in continued involvement and engagement on the social media site. Finally from Table 6 we observe that high self-disclosure posts receive fewer upvotes greater downvotes but higher number of comments as well as high response rate. Here response rate is calculated as the normalized time elapsed between post time and timestamp of first comment on the post. This shows that high self-disclosure on mental health subreddits while may not be highly endorsed by the greater Reddit community due to their caustic and disinhibiting tone however do receive social support through increased levels of engagement – commentary and rapidity of responses shows that the community is keen to help and advise these individuals with honest and disinhibiting self-disclosures. The greater conversational length as indicated by the high number of comments also aligns with prior literature where it has been found that candid discourse results in longer verbal exchange [4 10 14].
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12961-9,Forecasting the onset and course of mental illness with Twitter data,Summary Statistics,2,All data collection took place between February 1 2016 and June 10 2016. Across both depressed and healthy groups we collected data from 204 Twitter users totaling 279951 tweets. This number includes up to 3200 tweets from each participant’s Twitter history; the analyses in this report focus only on tweets from depressed users created before the date of first depression diagnosis. The mean number of posts per user was 1372.71 (SD = 1281.74). This distribution was skewed by a smaller number of frequent posters as evidenced by a median value of just 861 posts per user. See Table 1 for summary statistics. In the depressed group 147 crowdworkers successfully completed participation and provided access to their Twitter data. Imposing the CES-D cutoff reduced the number of viable participants to 105. The mean age for viable participants was 30.3 years (SD = 8.34) with a range of 18 to 64 years. Dates of participants’ first depression diagnoses ranged from March 2010 to February 2016 with nearly all diagnosis dates (92%) occurring in the period 2013–2015. In the healthy group 99 participants completed participation and provided access to their Twitter data. The mean age for this group was 33.9 years with a range of 19 to 63 years and 42% of respondents were female. (Gender data were not collected for affected sample surveys). For the PTSD analysis we collected data from 174 Twitter users totaling 243775. The mean number of posts per user was 1372.71 (SD = 1281.74). This distribution was skewed by a smaller number of frequent posters as evidenced by a median value of just 862 posts per user. In the PTSD sample 73 crowdworkers successfully completed participation and provided access to their Twitter data. Imposing the TSQ cutoff reduced the number of viable participants to 63. The mean age for viable participants was 30.64 years (SD = 7.57) with a range of 21 to 54 years. Dates of participants’ first PTSD diagnoses ranged from April 2010 to December 2015 with nearly all diagnosis dates (94%) occurring in the period 2013–2015. In the healthy group 111 participants completed participation and provided access to their Twitter data. The mean age for this group was 33.25 years with a range of 19 to 63 years and 51% of respondents were female.,
https://aclanthology.org/W14-3214.pdf,Towards Assessing Changes in Degree of Depression through Facebook,Dataset,2,We used a dataset of 28749 nonclinical users who opted into a Facebook application (“MyPersonality”; Kosinski and Stillwell 2012) between June 2009 and March 2011 completed a 100-item personality questionnaire (an International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) proxy to the NEO-PI-R (Goldberg 1999) and shared access to their status updates containing at least 500 words. Users wrote on average of 4236 words (69917624 total word instances) and a subset of 16507 users provided gender and age in which 57.0% were female and the mean age was 24.8. The dataset was divided into training and testing samples. In particular the testing sample consisted of a random set of 1000 users who wrote at least 1000 words and completed the personality measure while the training set contained the 27749 remaining users.,
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6784326,Affective and Content Analysis of Online Depression Communities,Data Sets,0,a) CLINICAL Communities: Communities who are interested in ‘depression’ and with at least 200 posts are extracted from LiveJournal. This is identified through the ‘Search communities by interest’ provided by LiveJournal and results in 24 communities with 38401 posts. The CLINICAL communities are grouped based on name and description of the individual community: depression bipolar self-harm attachment/separation and suicide (See Table 1 for statistics). The earliest community creation date was in 2001 thus our data set spans over 10 years. b) CONTROL communities: We constructed a CONTROL data set using five popular categories of communities in the LiveJournal Directory. We select communities who have at least 200 posts resulting in 23 communities with 229563 posts. This set is called CONTROL and the statistics of these 23 communities and their description are shown in Table 2.,
https://www.jmir.org/2017/7/e243/,Assessing Suicide Risk and Emotional Distress in Chinese Social Media: A Text Mining and Machine Learning Study,Data Collection,1,A Web-based survey of Weibo users was conducted to assess the respondents’ suicide risk and emotional distress (ie depression anxiety and stress). The invitation letter to participate in this survey was widely sent out to general Weibo users by various promotion activities. For a Weibo user to be eligible for the study she or he had to be 18 years or older (by self-report). A 30 Renminbi incentive for each complete survey was provided to boost the respond rate. With the respondents’ consent their Weibo posts that were posted in the public domain during the 12 months before the survey were downloaded by calling Weibo API. The survey fulfilled the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) checklist and details of the procedure have been reported in previous publications [2232]. In addition when multiple survey feedback were submitted from the same Internet protocol addresses only the first submission was used to avoid duplicate participation. In contrast to a previous study [32] this study excluded those who posted nothing throughout the 12 months but not those who posted fewer than 100 posts. Eventually data provided by 974 respondents remained for further analyses. The study has obtained ethical approvals from the Human Research Ethical Review Committee at the University of Hong Kong and the Institute Review Board of the Institute of Psychology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The survey measured respondents’ suicide probability score depression anxiety stress and Weibo suicide communication (WSC) as the outcome variables. In addition the respondents’ Weibo posts language features were extracted as independent variables or features for machine learning. The details of how those data were obtained are elaborated in the following subsections.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,A Social Media Based Index of Mental Well-Being in College Campuses,Data Demographic Representativeness,2,We first obtained a list of 150 ranked major universities in the United States by crawling the US News and World Report website [48]. This list is constructed based on the Carnegie classification employed extensively by higher education researchers and using a set of 16 indicators of academic excellence defined by US News. The list includes a variety of universities spread across the US in different settings (e.g. urban rural) and with a wide range of student enrollment sizes. Figure 1(a) shows their geographic distribution. As a part of this crawl we also obtained university metadata: gender distribution of students average tuition and fees and academic calendar (semester/quarter). To obtain further information about the nature of the student body we crawled the Wikipedia pages of all of the 150 universities. From these pages we extracted the size of student enrollment type (public/private) and setting (rural/suburban/urban/city) at every institution. These definitions come from a formal categorization scheme used by the US Department of Education. The student body enrollment sizes ranged from 2255 to 97494 with 98 public and 52 private universities. 50 universities were reported to be urban 47 city 39 suburban and 13 rural. Finally we obtained information on racial diversity of the universities from a website known as Priceonomics [58]. The website calculates the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) by combining the race/ethnicity distribution of student bodies at different universities with data given from the Department of Education. HHI ranges from 1 (the least diverse: a population of all one type) to 1/N (the most diverse) where N is the number of different racial categories being analyzed. Social Media Data of Universities Next we obtained social media data of the above universities. Specifically we focused on the social media Reddit. Why Reddit? Reddit is known to be a widely used online forum and social media site among the college student demographic [23]. Due to its forum structure it is extensively used for both content sharing as well as for obtaining feedback and information from communities of interest. Reddit harbors a variety of communities known as “subreddits” including many dedicated to specific university campuses. This allows a large sample of posts shared by students of a university to be collected in one place. Our preliminary manual inspection of university subreddits (e.g. r/gatech or r/KState) revealed that these subreddits are appropriated by students to discuss college topics (Table 1). Focusing on these public Reddit communities also does not require explicit data collection efforts to be coordinated at each of the 150 university sites. Although more students are likely to use Facebook due to its largely privately shared content it is challenging to obtain access to a large dataset of a university’s students. Next while Twitter is also widely adopted without explicit self-reported information it is challenging to identify college student accounts. Finally prior work [2 18] notes that semianonymity of Reddit enables candid self disclosure around stigmatized topics like mental health. Initial Data Acquisition. We leveraged the archive of all of Reddit data made available on Google’s BigQuery [11]. BigQuery is a cloud based managed data warehouse that allows third parties to access large publicly available dataset through simple SQL-type queries. Our queries grabbed all posts ranging between June 2011 and February 2016 available in the Reddit data archive. This included 424984 posts from 153378 unique users across all of the 146 universities with a mean of 2910.8 posts ( = 4329.6) and 1050 unique users ( = 1407) per subreddit. Filling the Gaps in Subreddit Data. The second step of our data collection process focused on identifying subreddits with insufficient data and supplementing them through additional alternative data collection. Through Reddit’s official API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) we obtained the most recent number of subscribers in the 146 university subreddits (as of July 2016). Then to investigate if and to what extent some subreddits may have had unusually low data as given in step 1 we determined the median unique user to subscriber ratio in each subreddit. This allows us to capture the subreddits where the subscriber count is high however the data obtained is not sufficiently representative. For subreddits with unique user to subscriber ratio under median (.42) (73 in all) we performed a one-time data collection using the Reddit API. This gave us a set of (at most) 1000 most recent posts for each subreddit with a total of 39824 posts added to the data obtained in step 1 following de-duplication. We note that this procedure did not skew the yearly distributions of data across the subreddits: The skew (yearly rate of change) before and after data filling were 4.86 and 5.05 respectively which were found to be statistically equivalent based on a two-sample equivalence test (p = .013 p = .025) a test that uses two one-sided t-tests on the before-after yearly rates of change from both sides of a chosen difference interval [1 1].,We note it is possible that the type of students who frequent the university subreddits could be consistently different from the student body at the same university. To examine the representativeness of our university subreddit data we employed a random sample of 500 posts distributed across the subreddits and the years for manual examination of demographics. Two researchers then independently coded these posts for self-reported gender race or academic stage (undergraduate/graduate). For instance from the post “I’m a junior transfer and this will be my second semester” the researchers identified the post author to be an undergraduate whereas from “Hi all! I’m a new grad student (male 22) here the gender of the author can be inferred to be male. We found the interrater agreement to be high: Cohen’s  = .84. The relative ratios between the gender race and academic stage distributions of the coded posts and the university student body (obtained based on our methodology in the subsection “University Data”) showed significant positive correlation: The mean undergrad/grad ratio in our labeled data was 2.9 while it was 2.6 in the universities. A two-sample test of equivalence gave p-values of .016 and .011 respectively with respect to the difference interval [.4 .4]. The sex (male/female) ratio for our labeled data was 1.6 also observed to be statistically equivalent to that of the student body 1.1 (p = .02 p = .03 w.r.t. the difference interval [.5 .5]). This establishes the validity of our acquired Reddit data as a representative data source for studying mental health disclosures in university campuses.
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7752434,MIDAS: Mental illness detection and analysis via social media,Feature Extraction,2,In this work we are focused on two main type of features (linguistic and behavioral). TF-IDF is adopted to model the linguist features of patients and Pattern of Life Features (PLF) adopted from the work of Coppersmith et al. [1] is used to model the behavioral style of patients. TF-IDF Features To capture the frequent and representative words used by the patients TF-IDF is applied on the unigram and bigrams collected from all the patients' tweets. Pattern of Life Features (PLF) These features reveal the emotional patterns and behavioral tendency of users by measuring polarity emotion and social interactions. In order to fully compose the PLF we combined the following list of features: Age and Gender: Twitter does not publicly provide information about the age and gender of its users mainly due to privacy concerns so we adopted the work of Sap et al. [5] to fill in this information. Polarity Features: The Sentiment140 API 3 was used to label each tweet as either positive negative or neutral. The polarity is furthermore transformed into five different values to capture the affective traits of each user: 1) Positive Ratio: the percentage of positive tweets 2) Negative Ratio: the percentage of negative tweets 3) Positive Combo: captures the mania and hypomania traits of patients which is determined by the number of continuous positive posts appearing more than x amount of times within a period of time in minutes T. 4) Negative Combos: captures the depression traits of patients and is determined by the number of continuous negative posts appearing more than x amount of times within a period of time in minutes T. 5) Flips Ratio: quantifies the emotional unstableness and is determined by counting how frequently two continuous tweets with different polarity (either positive to negative or negative to positive) appear together within a period of time in minutes T. In our work x is set to 2 and T is set to 30 minutes. Social Features: These features can demonstrate how users are behaving with respect to their environment. The following are the social features designed for each user: 1) Tweeting Frequency; the frequency of daily posts; 2) Mention Ratio: the percentage of posts which contain at least one mention of another user; 3) Frequent Mentions: the number of Twitter users mentioned more than three times which is a measurement of how many close friends a particular user may have; 4) Unique Mentions: the number of unique users mentioned which is a measure of the width of a user's social network.,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,A deep learning model for detecting mental illness from user content on social media,Data Collection,0,We collected post data from the following six mental-health-related subreddits each of which is reported to be associated with a specific disorder10: r/depression r/Anxiety r/bipolar r/BPD r/schizophrenia and r/autism. In addition we further collected post data from the most popular health-related subreddit17 r/mentalhealth to analyze posts with general health information. From each subreddit we collected all the user IDs who had at least one post related to the mental health. Along with user IDs we also collected titles and posts using the PushshiftAPI18. Note that all the user information is anonymized hence no personally identifiable information was not included; we followed all the anonymization process guided by the Sungkyunkwan University Institutional Review Board (IRB). Overall the current study collected information from 248537 users who wrote 633385 posts in the seven subreddits from January 2017 to December 2018. Table 1 summarizes the information of collected data.,
https://aclanthology.org/W19-3013.pdf,Mental Health Surveillance over Social Media with Digital Cohorts,Methodology Building Digital Cohorts,2,We now briefly describe our approach for cohortbased studies over social media. A more detailed description of the proposed methodology will appear in a forthcoming publication. Most works on social media analysis estimate trends by aggregating document-level signals inferred from arbitrary (and biased) data samples selected to match a predefined outcome. While some recent work has begun incorporating demographic information to contextualize analyses (Mandel et al. 2012; Mitchell et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2017 2019) and to improve representativeness of the data (Coppersmith et al. 2015b; Dos Reis and Culotta 2015) these studies still select on specific outcomes. We depart from these works by constructing a demographically representative digital cohort of social media users prior to the analyses and then conducting cohort-based studies over this preselected population. While a significant undertaking in most medical studies the vast quantities of available social media data make assembling social media cohorts feasible. Such cohorts can be used to support longitudinal and cross-sectional studies allowing experts to contextualize the outcomes produce externally valid trends from inherently biased samples and extrapolate those trends to a broader population. Similar strategies have been utilized in online surveys which can have comparable validity to other survey modalities simply by controlling for basic demographic features such as the location age ethnicity and gender (Duffy et al. 2005).,Our cohort construction process entails two key steps: first randomly selecting a large sample of Twitter users; and second annotating those users with key demographic attributes. While such attributes are not provided by the API automated methods can be used to infer such traits from data (Cesare et al. 2017). Following this approach we develop a demographic inference pipeline to automatically infer age gender race/ethnicity and location for each cohort candidate. Age Identifying age based on the content of a user can be challenging and exact age often cannot be determined based on language use alone. Therefore we use discrete categories that provide a more accurate estimate of age: Teenager (below 19) 20s 30s 40s 50s (50 years or older). Gender The gender was inferred using Demographer a supervised model that predicts the (binary) gender of Twitter users with features based on the name field on the user profile (Knowles et al. 2016). Race/Ethnicity The standard formulation of race and ethnicity is not well understood by the general public so categorizing social media users along these two axes may not be reasonable. Therefore we use a single measure of multicultural expression that includes five categories: White (W) Asian (A) Black (B) Hispanic (H) and Other. Location The location was inferred using Carmen an open-source library for geolocating tweets that uses a series of rules to lookup location strings in a location knowledge-base (Dredze et al. 2013). We use the inferred location to select users that live in the United States. The age and race/ethnicity attributes were inferred with custom supervised classifiers based on Amir et al. (2017)’s user-level model. The classifiers were trained and evaluated on a dataset of 5K annotated users attaining performances of 0.28 and 0.41 Average F1 respectively. See the supplemental notes for additional details on these experiments1 .

Reddit is a social media platform that was originally used for sharing and rating content such as news documentaries and music. Users post in and subscribe to self-organized communities known as subreddits; subscribing to a subreddit allows a user to view all posts from that subreddit. An advantage of analyzing Reddit data is that the subreddits are labelled according to their topics. Utilizing curated lists from volunteer Reddit users we crawled all subreddits related to mental health as well as all subreddits linked by these communities. The second dataset consists of anonymized journal posts from a mobile app designed to help people track their moods and share them anonymously if they desire. For each journal post the app requires the user to label the journal post with at least one mood selected from a pre-populated list including “happy” “sad” etc. We obtained all journals and the associated moods written between January 2016 and January 2017. This amounts to over 1.2 million journals written by approximately 75000 users. Figure 1 plots the number of journals posted over time. Most of the journals were written in the first half of 2016 although we inspected topic distributions per month and did not find seasonal effects. Towards the beginning of 2016 many new users registered on the app and eventually stopped using it. Like weight-loss and productivity apps we believe this influx is tied to users looking to improve their habits as a New Year’s resolution. Each journal can be set to be private or public (visible to all other users of the app). Roughly one third of all journals are public. Figure 2 plots the number of users on the y-axis versus the percentage of journals they posted publicly. Most users are either mostly private or mostly public. Most journals are relatively short just like Twitter posts that are at most 140 characters. The average length of a journal with text in it is 128 characters; there are roughly 100000 journal that have no text only a mood label. We observed that private users tend to write journals that are slightly but statistically significantly longer than those written by public users by approximately 10 characters. Figure 3 shows the distribution of journal lengths where the spikes correspond to 0 length (mood only) 200 characters (the default limit set by the app) and 300 characters (set as the maximum for visualization purposes). Users of the app can optionally enter their location age and gender. While most users did not enter this information we found that those who revealed their location are mostly from North America those who revealed their gender are predominantly female and those who revealed their age have an average age of 25.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557214,Seeking and sharing health information online: comparing search engines and social media,Health Information Seeking and Sharing Survey,2,To gain qualitative insight into people’s health information seeking and sharing practices we conducted an online survey during June 2013 using a recruiting service (Cint) that offers “Census representative sampling” in terms of gender and age throughout regions of the U.S. Respondents were paid approximately 4 USD to complete the survey and were required to have a Twitter account to qualify to participate. The survey comprised 37 questions and took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Participants were asked if they had ever sought health information on a search engine such as Google or Bing or on Twitter and whether they had ever shared health information on Twitter. If they answered affirmatively they were asked to describe the most recent occasion on which they did so including the health condition that motivated them to search or share and their objective in performing the activity. The survey included questions about how often participants used search engines and Twitter for various types of information seeking or sharing views about risks associated with each platform and basic demographics. In total 237 respondents completed the survey. After discarding low quality responses (as determined by nonsensical or sarcastic responses to open questions) 210 valid survey responses were analyzed. Of these respondents 53% were female they resided in 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and 43% had a college degree or higher. Ages ranged from 18 to 70 years (median = 35 years). Respondents reported using search engines frequently (76% at least once per day with only 7% using them less than once per week). 71% of respondents had public Twitter accounts while the remaining 29% had “protected” accounts (i.e. only approved followers could view their postings).,
https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/viewPaper/8075,Mental Health Discourse on reddit: Self-Disclosure Social Support and Anonymity,Data Collection,0,We collected post data from the following six mental-health-related subreddits each of which is reported to be associated with a specific disorder10: r/depression r/Anxiety r/bipolar r/BPD r/schizophrenia and r/autism. In addition we further collected post data from the most popular health-related subreddit17 r/mentalhealth to analyze posts with general health information. From each subreddit we collected all the user IDs who had at least one post related to the mental health. Along with user IDs we also collected titles and posts using the PushshiftAPI18. Note that all the user information is anonymized hence no personally identifiable information was not included; we followed all the anonymization process guided by the Sungkyunkwan University Institutional Review Board (IRB). Overall the current study collected information from 248537 users who wrote 633385 posts in the seven subreddits from January 2017 to December 2018. Table 1 summarizes the information of collected data.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025932,Modeling and Understanding Visual Attributes of Mental Health Disclosures in Social Media,Data Reliability,0,Next we assessed the suitability and reliability of our collected corpus of Instagram posts and users for our later analyses. For the purpose we extracted n-grams (n=3) from the profile biographies of users. The top 10 uni- bi- and trigrams are shown in Table 3. They show that users are appropriating Instagram to seek and provide social and emotional support around different mental health concerns (“need someone talk” “feel free dm”). There are also explicit mentions of specific psychological challenges around mental health (“depression anxiety” “telling suicidal kids”) including warnings for profile visitors (“trigger warning”) and personal experiences of the condition (“alone alone alone”). We corroborated these observations with a licensed psychiatrist and concluded that the users in our dataset are engaging in genuine mental health disclosures tend to demonstrate disinhibition towards sharing their mental health experiences and are appropriating the platform specifically for this purpose via the chosen account.,
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300996,A content analysis of depression-related tweets,Demographics of Twitter Users,2,Tweets where individuals expressed feelings of depression (and were not deemed trivial) was a popular theme of the tweets in our random sample and given the potential clinical implications associated with these social media messages our research team had interest in characterizing the demographic characteristics of these individuals. Accordingly Table 3 presents the inferred characteristics of Twitter users who tweeted about feeling depressed (n = 419) compared to the inferred demographics of a random sample of 20000 Tweeters in the US and Canada. Those tweeting about feeling depressed tended to be ≤ 25 years old (94%) which is similar to the typical Twitter user (94% ≤ 25 years old) but the distribution of ages under the age of 25 appeared to differ between the two groups (see Table 3). The vast majority of individuals who tweeted about feeling depressed were girls/women (77%) in comparison to the typical Twitter user (58%). Most of the individuals who tweeted about feeling depressed were inferred to be Caucasian (52%). This prevalence is lower when compared against the typical Twitter user (64% Caucasian). More tweeters who disclosed feeling depressed were African American than the typical Twitter user (35% versus 24%).,
https://aclanthology.org/W15-1202.pdf,Quantifying the Language of Schizophrenia in Social Media,Age- and Gender- Matched Controls,2,Since mental health conditions including schizophrenia have different prevalence rates depending on age and gender (among other demographic variables) controlling for these will be important when examining systematic differences between schizophrenic users and community controls. In particular we would like to be able to attribute any quantifiable signals we observe to the presence or absence of schizophrenia rather than to a confounding age or gender divergence between the populations (Dos Reis and Culotta 2015). To that end we estimated the age and gender of all our users (from their language usage) via the tools graciously made available by the World Well-Being Project (Sap et al. 2014). For each user we applied a hard threshold to the gender prediction to obtain a binary ‘Female’ or ‘Male’ label. Then in order to select the best match for each schizophrenia user we selected the community control that had the same gender label and was closest in age (without replacement).,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2700171.2791026,Detecting Changes in Suicide Content Manifested in Social Media Following Celebrity Suicides,Developing a Control,0,Next we develop a control to establish that changes in volume of posts in SW succeeding a celebrity suicide compared to that preceding it is attributed to the topic of suicide in particular and such changes are not part of a broader shift in interest in mental health topics. For this purpose we identified a set of “control group” subreddits which are on topics related to mental health but are unlikely to be specifically about suicide or suicidal ideation. These mental health subreddits (henceforth referred to as MH subreddits) were compiled based on our prior work in [11]; refer to the paper for details on how these subreddits are identified and crawled. Table 3 lists the control subreddits crawled in the same timeframe as SW. We obtained 32509 posts from 23807 unique users. Like SW all of these subreddits are public.,
https://aclanthology.org/W17-3110.pdf,Small but Mighty: Affective Micropatterns for Quantifying Mental Health from Social Media Language,Data,2,We briefly explain the data collection method here but we refer the interested reader with further questions on the methodology to Coppersmith et al. (2016) for the suicide attempt data and Coppersmith et al. (2014a) for all other conditions. The data for these analyses are Twitter posts collected via two methods. Most of the data come from users who have publicly discussed their mental health conditions. These users are frequently referred to as “self-stated diagnosis” users as they state publicly something like “I was diagnosed with schizophrenia” or “I’m so thankful to have survived my suicide attempt last year”. The data for users with a suicide attempt was supplemented by data from OurDataHelps.org a data donation site where people provide access to their public posts and fill out a short questionnaire about their mental health history. Data are then deidentified and made available to researchers addressing questions of interest to the mental health community. Donors provide consent for their data to be used in mental health research upon signup. Of the users who attempted suicide 146 came from OurDataHelps.org. Specifically we examine generalized anxiety disorder eating disorders panic attacks schizophrenia and attempted suicides. These conditions were selected based on the theory that there are important timing aspects to their symptoms – ebbing and flowing of symptoms as treatment is effective (especially schizophrenia) onset and exacerbation of symptoms by external events and stress and punctuated events in time of psychological symptoms (suicide attempts panic attacks and binging/purging behavior with eating disorders). We use the Twitter streaming API to collect a sample of users who used a series of mental health words or phrases in their tweet text (e.g. ‘schizophrenia‘ or ‘suicide attempt‘). Each tweet that uses one of these phrases is examined via regular expression to indicate that the user is talking about themselves. Finally those tweets that pass the regular expression are examined by a human to confirm (to the best of our ability) that their selfstatement of diagnosis appears to be genuine. This results in a dataset with users that have a self-stated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2408) an eating disorder (749) panic attacks (263) schizophrenia (350) or someone who would go on to attempt suicide (423). Some of these users do not exhibit the sort of posting behavior required to create micropatterns (i.e. they rarely post multiple times within a 3 hour time window). We exclude these users from our analysis which is 5-9% of users for most conditions with the exception of those with a suicide attempt where a little over half the users do not exhibit this posting behavior. The resultant dataset used for analyses is: generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2271) eating disorders (687) panic attacks (247) schizophrenia (318) suicide attempts (157). In order to allow comparisons of each condition to control users we gather a random sample of 10000 Twitter users for whom at least 75% of their posts are identified by Twitter as English. All the users with a self-stated diagnoses and all members of this control population have their age and gender estimated according to Sap et al. (2014). For each user with a self-stated diagnosis we find a matched control through the following procedure: create a pool of users where the estimated gender matches and the estimated age is within the same 10-year bracket (the suggested accuracy of the age estimator). From that pool of age- and gender- matched users we select the user whose tweets start and end over the most similar timeframe. We will refer to these age- gender- and time-matched controls simply as “matched controls” throughout the rest of this paper. All tweets were publicly posted by their author (i.e. no users marked at “protected” or “private” were included). On average users had 2949 tweets. The distribution of estimated age and genders for users with each self-stated condition can be seen in Figure 1. For most conditions the population skews female though for schizophrenia the genders are roughly balanced. The average age tends to be in the early-to-mid 20s.,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2998181.2998220,Gender and Cross-Cultural Differences in Social Media Disclosures of Mental Illness,Gender and Country Inference Gender Inference,2,In order to allow gender based and cross-cultural comparisons of the above data we now present an automated gender and country name inference method — Twitter does not allow individuals an ability to self-report their gender whereas location information is known to be highly noisy [22]. We also note the need for such a method given the size of our two datasets that makes human coding of gender and country names challenging from a practical perspective.,For inferring gender of a user in our two datasets we compared account names to existing name databases. First of all we started cleaning the account names and subsequently identifying the first and last name on the basis of a 1-gram lookup. Thereafter we compared the names to country-specific name databases. For this the country origin of a Twitter user was firstly retrieved using the Country Name Inference giving the user’s specified location. If the gender could not be retrieved using the previous method it would look up the name over all the country-specific lookup tables. For analytical simplicity we only consider binary gender (female/male) in this paper.
https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e14199/,Detecting Signs of Depression in Tweets in Spanish: Behavioral and Linguistic Analysis,Data Collection and User Selection,0,The selection of the tweets and their users was based on the filtered real-time streaming support provided by the Twitter API. In the first step we selected the users who showed potential signs of depression on Twitter on the basis of the 20 most frequent words in Spanish expressed by patients suffering from depression in clinical settings. These words were jointly identified and selected by a psychologist and a family physician with clinical experience and were based on the definition and general features of depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [42]. The list of words used and their English translations are shown in Textbox 1.During June 2018 1470000 tweets including 1 or more occurrences of the words listed in Textbox 1 were collected. From this collection of tweets and to select the users who publicly stated in the textual description associated to their profile that they suffered from depression all the profile descriptions including 1 or more occurrences of the word “depr” and all the possible derivations related to the word depression in Spanish such as “depre” “depresión” “depresivo” “depresiva” “deprimido” and “deprimida” were considered. From the 720 users who included 1 or more of these words in their description profile 90 users who stated they suffered from depression or were receiving treatment for depression were selected for the analysis. This selection was performed by a psychologist verifying that the statements were related to real expressions of depression excluding quotes jokes or fake ones. For each of these depressed Twitter users we collected all the most recent tweets from their timeline up to a maximum of about 3200 tweets. Thus a total of 189669 tweets were collected a figure that was reduced to 140946 after discarding the retweets. These 140946 tweets constituted the depressive users dataset. Examples of sentences appearing in the user profiles that were used for selecting the depressive users are: “Paciente psiquiátrico con depresión crónica” (Psychiatric patient with chronic depression; example of a profile sentence that indicates depression). “Colecciono errores traducidos a tweets depresivos y a uno que otro impulso de amor” (I gather errors translated into depressing tweets and into one or another love impulse; example of a profile sentence that does not indicate depression. Once the users with profile sentences indicating depression had been retrieved their Twitter timelines were collected. Only those users having in their timeline at least 10 tweets that suggested signs of depression were retained for further analyses. For each user the selection of these tweets was performed by manually inspecting the tweets of the user’s complete timeline in reverse temporal order starting from the most recent one to the oldest tweet of the timeline retrieved by means of the Twitter API . Finally a total number of 1000 tweets issued by the 90 depressive users suggesting signs of depression were detected and used for the analysis. This set of tweets provided us with the depressive tweets dataset which was used to analyze linguistic features of tweets showing signs of depression. It has to be mentioned that these 1000 tweets were not to be included in the depressive users dataset (see Figure 1). At the same time more than 97500000 tweets were also collected in June 2018: such tweets were gathered by listening to the public Twitter stream during this time span by only considering tweets with Spanish textual contents (as detected by Twitter language identification support). Given that Twitter requires more restrictive filters than just the language of the tweets we used a list of the most frequently used Spanish words (stopwords) to retrieve all tweets that included 1 or more of these words. The vast majority of Spanish tweets should match this criterion. A sample of 450 users who did not mention in their profile the word depression and its derivations were selected randomly from the 97500000 tweets. The complete timelines of these users were compiled (1141021 tweets) which were reduced to 712589 once retweets were removed. These 712589 tweets constituted the control dataset. To identify the language of a tweet we relied on the language automatically identified by Twitter for each tweet selecting tweets in Spanish. It has to be noted that these data can contain some tweets from unidentified depressive users.,
https://aclanthology.org/W18-0608.pdf,Cross-cultural differences in language markers of depression online,Measures Descriptive Statistics,2,Users of the service completed a questionnaire at sign-up in which they provided information about their demographic characteristics and mental health. Demographic characteristics assessed included age gender and ethnicity. Ethnicity response categories were White Asian or Pacific Islander Black or African American Latino or Hispanic Native American or American Indian or Other. Users could only select one ethnic group category. Users also select the primary reason for using 7 Cups and the users above all indicated a primary purpose of “Depression”.,Data was anonymous and users were analyzed in aggregate by cultural group. No personallyidentifiable information was available. We report descriptive statistics to give a sense of the overall composition of the sample. Table 1 outlines demographic characteristics and mental health status of participants. Overall participants were predominantly female (67.3 percent) white (68.6 percent) young adults (m = 21.4 SD = 7.6) who were somewhat distressed at sign-up (7/10). No statistically significant or meaningful differences in age gender or sign-up distress level were found between cultural groups and thus these characteristics were not controlled for in subsequent analyses.
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359169,Cross-Cultural Differences in the Use of Online Mental Health Support Forums,Method of Analysis,2,"Selection Criteria and Data Scope. To understand the impact of cultural differences on how individuals use online mental health platforms we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of users from different national communities on Talklife a support platform with over half a million users [91]. For this analysis due to the fact that most research in CSCW on mental health online has been done either agnostic of cultural context [12 34] or in a Western context [60 67 88] we choose to focus on users from non-Western countries following Zhang et al. [103]. As researchers located in the Global South and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory models [52] of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of CSCW and CSCWadjacent mental health research away from the West is crucial to better meet the needs of people often underserved by the medical system [70]. To create these subgroups of users we choose the three non-Western countries with the highest user populations on Talklife or India Malaysia and the Philippines. Guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuances to mental health expression for each country [35 62 77 80] we examine the national identity linguistic and behavior-based differences of use between each user subgroup. In particular this research notes that as a result of cultural norms around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualizations of mental illness in India Malaysia and the Philippines symptoms are often expressed in somatic and religious terms as opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric terms. We choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reasons. On a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity has commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity [31 33 52]. Additionally on a more practical level each user’s country was determined using their IP address by Talklife and shared with us in an user-anonymized dataset. Inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity as discussed in past work [47] and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural differences than analysis at the national level. We analyze data from 10532 Indian users 3370 Malaysian users and 3370 Filipino users as shown in Table 2. Collectively we refer to these countries as the minority sample. As a comparison set we construct a random sample of all threads on Talklife and refer to it as the majority sample. Due to the relative prevalence of users from Western English-speaking countries in Talklife most of the threads in the majority sample include posts from countries such as the USA UK and Canada. Indians are the largest non-Western minority subgroup on Talklife. Data was sampled from May 2012 to June 2018. Following this cross-national analysis to see if our broader results on Talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest Western country (the United States) and the largest non-Western country (India) represented on 7Cups a similar support platform with more than 15000 users actively using the platform each week [7]. Using 7Cups data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural differences we found in our Talklife sample. For this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from 6055 Indian users and 18581 American users as shown in Table 2. Unlike our sample of Talklife users this dataset is not a random sample. There is an upsampling of Indian users to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of Indians in the dataset. Like on Talklife Indians are the largest non-Western minority subgroup on 7Cups. We focus on Indian users due to a lack of sufficient data on users from Malaysia or the Philippines. Data was sampled from March 2014 - August 2018. 3.1.2 Defining Cultural Identity and Use of Clinical Language. In this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forums. To do so we leverage Tomlinson’s definition of cultural identity as “self and communal definitions based around specific usually politically inflected differentiations: gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality"" [94] particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that runs along national lines as delineated by Hall et al. [41]. As a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other forms of identity including religious or ethnic identity. However in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity as a proxy for cultural identity. Additionally following Schlesinger et al’s [83] call for more intersectional analyses and methods within HCI we also include analyses of adjacent and intersecting identities when relevant including religious identity. To analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnoses. Following methods used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language [30] we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigrams and trigrams from a list of mental disorders as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [100]. We also included all unigrams from the MacMillan Dictionary list of words used to describe illnesses and diseases both specifically for mental illness and general illness [1–3]. As a result we include unigrams like “night"" (from night terrors) or sleep (from “sleep disorder"") as these are often correlated with specific symptoms of mental illness or distress such as sleep issues or being awake at night [30]. This included any clinically common abbreviations for mental disorders such as OCD for “obsessive compulsive disorder"" or BPD for “borderline personality disorder."" Shorthand for disorders commonly used by online communities such as “pro-ana” (as used in pro-eating disorder communities) [22] were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these terms across disorders. We choose to use terms from and associated with DSM and ICD categorized disorders as a result of the common usage of these frameworks globally [99]. Throughout our analysis of these varied factors we use µ to represent means and σ to represent standard deviations. 3.1.3 Constraints Limitations and Tradeoffs. Cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting levels including subcultures and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity. As a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraints in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis. One large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level as a proxy for cultural identity. Though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity as argued by both Hall [41] and Tomlinson [94] each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identities that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity [54 64 89]. A more rich analysis of these other forms of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusions about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support communities particularly with regard to cultural differences between users with the same national identity. Additionally to stay consistent between analyses as a result of a lack of data on users from Malaysia and the Philippines we only analyze users in India on 7Cups and extend these findings to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum. We draw validity for these exploratory findings from similar consistent patterns we observe between Indian Malaysian and Filipino users but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority communities these conclusions do not hold true. Additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used DSM and ICD both frameworks of illness categorization have significant limitations particularly in the countries we have selected. For example there are both mental health disorders that are culturebound [74] as well as mental health language that is used in different ways within the specific countries we analyze such as depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illnesses [53]. Additionally it is clear that online support communities often develop their own cultural norms and language around mental health [21 72] and a deeper understanding of how this plays out on Talklife and 7Cups is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work. In this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical terms for mental health disorders in our analysis of clinical language. As detailed in past anthropological research [52] it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across cultures as a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder as opposed to conceptualizing distress as “stress"" “tension"" or “depression"" [25 53 98]. For our analysis we strictly analyzed posts that were in the Latin alphabet with almost all posts on both Talklife and 7Cups being in English. However as both Malay [8] and Tagalog [82] are most commonly written in the Latin script and since it is common for users from India speakers to use romanized versions of Indian languages online [79] it is possible that a small minority of posts in our analysis were text in a different language. However as confirmed by only seeing English words used in our analysis of the top n-grams among each user subgroup it is clear that English is the predominant language on both platforms. Though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of non-English code-switching on these platforms could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interactions on expression between users with the same national identity but different language preferences.",
https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2197-z,Automatic extraction of informal topics from online suicidal ideation,Suicide Watch,0,In this section we first present the data gathered and used in our analysis. Researchers interested in the code and the data are invited to contact the authors. Reddit is a website which enables users to aggregate rate and discuss news entertainment politics and many other topics. According to Alexa it is the 8th most popular website in the world. It was estimated by the Pew research center that 6% of online adults use Reddit [26]. The site is organized into a collection of “subreddits” each focused on a particular topic and administered by a collection of moderators. The subreddit r/SuicideWatch is a forum in which online users are encouraged to post their thoughts regarding suicide. At the time of our data collection it had over 58000 subscribers. Sometimes users express a preoccupation with the thought of suicide. Other times users discuss immediate plans to take their own life. These posts often contain a description of their mental state including depression reaction to stress their feelings of being alone and having a low self-esteem. While most online sources of data are notoriously noisy this particular subreddit is remarkably clean. Given the serious nature of the subreddit individuals are less likely to post harassing comments or off-topic remarks. When users post such comments the moderators of the subreddit quickly remove them. We collected all posts from its inception in 2008 to 2016. Each post is often commented on by other individuals. In this work we focused on the original post as it most often represents the suicidal ideation of a user and comments often represent emotional support from other users. We cleaned this data. First we removed empty posts in which the content had been deleted. Second we removed links and replaced them with the word “link”. Third we concatenated the text of the post to the title as many users begin their post in the title and continue in the body of the post. Finally we removed punctuation and other special characters.
