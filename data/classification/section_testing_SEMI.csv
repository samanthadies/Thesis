of local time of the post author our motivation spring from observation in the depression literature indicating that user showing depression sign tend to be relatively more active during the evening and night for the purpose we define a night window in a given day a pmam consequently the day window for the same user in local time would be ampm for each post we therefore assign a time index or

https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2464464.2464480,1,9,,"De Choudhury, Counts, Horvits",3,1,0,0,2013,we now utilize smdi to understand a variety of population characteristic of depression geographical analysis we present analysis on how our social medium depression index reflects the known depression rate in several u city and state first we collected a list of city reported by businessweekcom to be the unhappiest u city the list includes a percity depression rank a measured by prescription drug claim for common antidepressant these statistic were reported at end of using twitter firehose we crawled random sample of twitter post english language per month between jan and dec for each city to approximately match the time period around which these number were reported note that matching a post with a city wa made based on the post author selfreport location on the twitter profile although other sophisticated location inference scheme may be adopted in future work table give statistic of the data crawled for each city we used our trained prediction model to label all the post shared every day from each city on whether they were depressionindicative and thereafter computed the corresponding smdi per day eqn we further calculated a mean smdi per city throughout the time of analysis figure show the social medium depression index of all the city yaxis against their reported ranking in term of depression rate xaxis the main observation in the figure is that we observe reasonable correlation r between our computed smdi and known depression rate in the various city note that the slope of the trend line in the figure is positive this is because we are predicting depression rank for which lower rank implies worse condition on examination of the trend it appears that we may be overestimating the degree of depression in more city eg portland cleveland louisville atlanta kansa city than the number of city for which we underestimating the degree of depression eg new orleans detroit to the extent this is true this may be an artifact of a general tendency for people to express relatively more negativity on twitter prior literature show that negative affect is more predominantly expressed on twitter than is positive affect thus our model may be misinterpreting some expression of negativity a depressionindicative next we expand our geographical analysis to understand how smdi reflects actual depression rate in the u state in this case we obtain data on depression rate in the various state from the center for disease control and prevention cdc per the behavioral risk surveillance survey brfss conducted in for computing smdi we follow a similar approach a done with the city that is we compile a set of twitter post for each state based on regex matching of the state name with the user selfreported location on twitter our twitter data go back to june and thus to best align with the cdc data we collected a sample of twitter data over a six month period between jun and dec there were a total of approximately m post over all the state in our sample thus compiled figure show heat map rendering of actual and predicted depression rate in various stateshigher intensity color imply greater depression rate reported by cdc top or greater smdi bottom using the exact percent of each state population that is depressed a opposed to the binned value in figure the pearson correlation between actual perstate rate of depression and those predicted by smdi is found to be this demonstrates that our metric can capture to a reasonable extent the actual rate of depression known in these state demographic analysis gender difference in this section we perform a demographiccentric analysis of depression comparing men and woman our goal is to be able to examine whether the rate of depression a found by the brfss survey same source a above for men and woman align with the smdi rate for the purpose we utilize the same corpus of twitter post used in the analysis reported in figure this analysis however necessitated that we know the gender of the author of a post which is not an available attribute from twitter hence we utilized a gender classifier that us regex matching of twitter selfreported first name of user with a gazetteer of name and gender collated from u census baby name list and public facebook profile a found in a gender classifier of this type is known to yield accuracy between in our corpus we obtained about woman and the rest men after about coverage over all user for each post for which the author gender wa inferred we computed the individualcentric measure of smdi see eqn figure show the result we observe that we can reasonably predict the percentage of men and woman depressed woman are known to suffer from time more depression than men approximately that ratio is observed in our prediction a well time in our case a given by the actual rate of percent depressed in figure this is denoted by the nearly parallel line for predicted and actual percent of each gender who are depressed however a with our previous analysis on geography we observe a slight overestimation of depression when using our method interestingly it appears that overestimation is higher for woman than for men notice the smdi value specifically one possibility is that woman generally show greater emotional expressivity than men typically negative in affect hence leading to a bias in our model temporal analysis in this final section on populationscale analysis we focus on understanding some of the temporal pattern of depression at diurnal and annual scale we first use the same data a used in figure to study level of smdi over the course of a typical day in local time across men and woman this is shown in figure a in correspondence with our finding in figure we see that diurnal smdi value for woman are higher than that of men p although they have high correlation r an interesting finding of this study is that for both men and woman smdi is higher during the night than during the day with smdi value peaking at around midnight and the lowest value appearing around noon a mentioned before psychiatric literature on depression indicates that out of people suffering from depression exhibit worsened symptom at night people become more prone to worrying thought at night due to loneliness break from work lack of energy or other interaction between lightdarkness and the nervous system next we study the rhythm of smdi over the course of a year aggregated in pitstops of month for this purpose we expand the above dataset and derive two sample of twitter post ranging between jun may and jan dec m post in all the yearly pattern of smdi for several u city chosen for exemplary purpose with high depression rate see figure for detail are shown in figure averaged across the two dataset snapshot we also show an average trend for all post combining all location denoted a all we observe that the yearly depression pattern show a seasonal trend with highest depression observed during winter season in the u decjan while the lowest during summer junaug and to some extent fall sepnov clinical literature indicates that there is greater prevalence of depressive anxiety during winter at northern latitude sometimes attributed to insufficient exposure to light during winter across the city we observe that smdi in certain city is more associated with weather condition than others jacksonville and seattle are both ranked high in term of depression rate however the variation in smdi trend for seattle is much higher than that for jacksonville in fact the percent difference between seattle and jacksonville smdi during winter is higher than that during summer note that seattle seasonal weather variation are more extreme than those for jacksonville per national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa a also supported by clinical literature we thus conjecture that twitter user based in seattle are more prone to depressive symptom during winter than in jacksonville or other low weather variability city however notice that even during the summer city like jacksonville and other low weather variation city eg nashville show considerable depression prevalence smdi for jacksonville in summer is which is higher compared to some of the other city that is it appears that while weather may have a strong role to play in the depression rate there are likely to be other factor at play for instance socioeconomic status unemployment rate which may explain the higher smdi in these city to summarize we observe persistent rhythm in depression expression on social medium during the course of a day across men and woman and even at a seasonal level across a variety of location this provides u with a promising mechanism to monitor finegrained temporal trend of depression across population demographic and region,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,we now utilize smdi to understand a variety of population characteristic of depression geographical analysis we present analysis on how our social medium depression index reflects the known depression rate in several u city and state first we collected a list of city reported by businessweekcom to be the unhappiest u city the list includes a percity depression rank a measured by prescription drug claim for common antidepressant these statistic were reported at end of using twitter firehose we crawled random sample of twitter post english language per month between jan and dec for each city to approximately match the time period around which these number were reported note that matching a post with a city wa made based on the post author selfreport location on the twitter profile although other sophisticated location inference scheme may be adopted in future work table give statistic of the data crawled for each city we used our trained prediction model to label all the post shared every day from each city on whether they were depressionindicative and thereafter computed the corresponding smdi per day eqn we further calculated a mean smdi per city throughout the time of analysis figure show the social medium depression index of all the city yaxis against their reported ranking in term of depression rate xaxis the main observation in the figure is that we observe reasonable correlation r between our computed smdi and known depression rate in the various city note that the slope of the trend line in the figure is positive this is because we are predicting depression rank for which lower rank implies worse condition on examination of the trend it appears that we may be overestimating the degree of depression in more city eg portland cleveland louisville atlanta kansa city than the number of city for which we underestimating the degree of depression eg new orleans detroit to the extent this is true this may be an artifact of a general tendency for people to express relatively more negativity on twitter prior literature show that negative affect is more predominantly expressed on twitter than is positive affect thus our model may be misinterpreting some expression of negativity a depressionindicative next we expand our geographical analysis to understand how smdi reflects actual depression rate in the u state in this case we obtain data on depression rate in the various state from the center for disease control and prevention cdc per the behavioral risk surveillance survey brfss conducted in for computing smdi we follow a similar approach a done with the city that is we compile a set of twitter post for each state based on regex matching of the state name with the user selfreported location on twitter our twitter data go back to june and thus to best align with the cdc data we collected a sample of twitter data over a six month period between jun and dec there were a total of approximately m post over all the state in our sample thus compiled figure show heat map rendering of actual and predicted depression rate in various stateshigher intensity color imply greater depression rate reported by cdc top or greater smdi bottom using the exact percent of each state population that is depressed a opposed to the binned value in figure the pearson correlation between actual perstate rate of depression and those predicted by smdi is found to be this demonstrates that our metric can capture to a reasonable extent the actual rate of depression known in these state demographic analysis gender difference in this section we perform a demographiccentric analysis of depression comparing men and woman our goal is to be able to examine whether the rate of depression a found by the brfss survey same source a above for men and woman align with the smdi rate for the purpose we utilize the same corpus of twitter post used in the analysis reported in figure this analysis however necessitated that we know the gender of the author of a post which is not an available attribute from twitter hence we utilized a gender classifier that us regex matching of twitter selfreported first name of user with a gazetteer of name and gender collated from u census baby name list and public facebook profile a found in a gender classifier of this type is known to yield accuracy between in our corpus we obtained about woman and the rest men after about coverage over all user for each post for which the author gender wa inferred we computed the individualcentric measure of smdi see eqn figure show the result we observe that we can reasonably predict the percentage of men and woman depressed woman are known to suffer from time more depression than men approximately that ratio is observed in our prediction a well time in our case a given by the actual rate of percent depressed in figure this is denoted by the nearly parallel line for predicted and actual percent of each gender who are depressed however a with our previous analysis on geography we observe a slight overestimation of depression when using our method interestingly it appears that overestimation is higher for woman than for men notice the smdi value specifically one possibility is that woman generally show greater emotional expressivity than men typically negative in affect hence leading to a bias in our model temporal analysis in this final section on populationscale analysis we focus on understanding some of the temporal pattern of depression at diurnal and annual scale we first use the same data a used in figure to study level of smdi over the course of a typical day in local time across men and woman this is shown in figure a in correspondence with our finding in figure we see that diurnal smdi value for woman are higher than that of men p although they have high correlation r an interesting finding of this study is that for both men and woman smdi is higher during the night than during the day with smdi value peaking at around midnight and the lowest value appearing around noon a mentioned before psychiatric literature on depression indicates that out of people suffering from depression exhibit worsened symptom at night people become more prone to worrying thought at night due to loneliness break from work lack of energy or other interaction between lightdarkness and the nervous system next we study the rhythm of smdi over the course of a year aggregated in pitstops of month for this purpose we expand the above dataset and derive two sample of twitter post ranging between jun may and jan dec m post in all the yearly pattern of smdi for several u city chosen for exemplary purpose with high depression rate see figure for detail are shown in figure averaged across the two dataset snapshot we also show an average trend for all post combining all location denoted a all we observe that the yearly depression pattern show a seasonal trend with highest depression observed during winter season in the u

that statistical classifier can differentiate user with four different mental health disorder depression bipolar post traumatic stress disorder and seasonal affective disorder we conduct a liwc analysis of each disorder to measure deviation in each illness group from a control group replicating previous finding for depression and providing new finding for bipolar ptsd and sad we conduct an openvocabulary analysis that capture language use relevant to mental health beyond what is captured with liwc our result open the door to a range of large scale analysis of mental health issue using

social engagement ha been correlated with positive mental health outcome greetham et al berkman et al organization de choudhury et al d which is difficult to measure directly so we examine various way in which this may be manifest in a user tweet stream tweet rate measure how often a twitter user post a measure of overall engagement with this social medium platform and proportion of tweet with mention measure how often a user post in conversation for lack of better term with other user number of mention is a measure of how often the user in question engages other user while number of self mention is a measure of how often the user responds to mention of themselves since user rarely include their own username in a tweet to estimate the size of a user social network we calculate number of unique user mentioned and number of user mentioned at least time respectively for each of the following analytics we calculate the proportion of a user tweet that the analytic find evidence in insomnia and sleep disturbance is often a symptom of mental health disorder weissman et al de choudhury et al d so we calculate the proportion of tweet that a user make between midnight and am according to their local timezone exercise ha also been correlated with positive mental health outcome penedo and dahn callaghan so we examine tweet mentioning one of a small set of exerciserelated term we also use an english sentiment analysis lexicon from mitchell et al to score individual tweet according to the presence and valence of sentiment word we apply no threshold so any tweet with a

they do not depend on significant nlp they examine how correlate found to be significant in the mental health literature may manifest and be measured in social medium data these are all imperfect proxy for the finding from the literature but our experiment will demonstrate that they do collectively provide information relevant to mental health for each of the following analytics we extract one feature to use in subsequent machine learning social engagement ha been correlated with positive mental health outcome greetham et al berkman et al organization de choudhury et al d which is difficult to measure directly so we examine various way in which this may be manifest in a user tweet stream tweet rate measure how often a twitter user post a measure of overall engagement with this social medium platform and proportion of tweet with mention measure how often a user post in conversation for lack of better term with other user number of mention is a measure of how often the user in question engages other user while number of self mention is a measure of how often the user responds to mention of themselves since user rarely include their own username in a tweet to estimate the size of a user social network we calculate number of unique user mentioned and number of user mentioned at least time respectively for each of the following analytics we calculate the proportion of a user tweet that the analytic find evidence in insomnia and sleep disturbance is often a symptom of mental health disorder weissman et al de choudhury et al d so we calculate the proportion of tweet that a user make between midnight and am according to their local timezone exercise ha also been correlated with positive mental health outcome penedo and dahn callaghan so we examine tweet mentioning one of a small set of exerciserelated term we also use an english sentiment analysis lexicon from mitchell et al to score individual tweet according to the presence and valence of sentiment word we apply no threshold so any tweet with a sentiment score above wa considered positive below wa considered negative and those with score were considered to have no sentiment thus we use the proportion of insomnia exercise positive sentiment and negative sentiment tweet a feature in subsequent machine learning and

firstperson singular pronoun liwc dictionary p i my me suggesting a preoccupation with the self firstperson singular pronoun were found by a recent metaanalysis to be one of the most robust language marker of crosssectional depression metaanalytic r and by a preliminary longitudinal study a marker of future depression a observed in this study although there is substantial evidence that the use of firstperson singular pronoun is associated with depression in private writing this study extends the evidence for this association into the semipublic context of social medium cognitively depression is thought to be associated with perseveration and rumination specifically on selfrelevant information which manifest a worry and anxiety when directed toward the future in line with these conceptualization we observed language marker suggestive of increased rumination topic mind alot lot p and anxiety liwc dictionary p scared upset worry albeit not meeting benjaminihochbergcorrected significance threshold depression often present itself with somatic complaint in primary care setting in our sample we observed that the text of user who ultimately received a diagnosis of depression

of mental health assessment and treatment and thus a useful lens for mental health analysis the psychology literature ha a long history of studying the impact of various mental health condition on a person language use more recently the computational linguistics community ha sought to develop technology to address clinical psychology challenge some of this work ha appeared at the computational linguistics and clinical psychology workshop resnik et al mitchell et al the workshop hosted a shared and unshared task these task focused on fundamental computational linguistics technology that hold promise to improve mental healthrelated application in particular detecting signal relevant to mental health in language data and associated metadata specifically technology that can demonstrably separate community control from those with mentalhealth condition are extracting signal relevant to mental health examining the signal those technique extract and depend on for classification can yield insight into how aspect of mental health are manifested in language usage to that end the shared and unshared task examined twitter user who publicly stated a diagnosis of depression or ptsd and

people will die from those attempt suicide death have increased by in the past year making suicide one of the top cause of death in the united state a pattern that seems to be constant across geographic region within the country not only is the magnitude of the problem large and worsening there ha been little progress made over the past year in understanding suicide and improving outcome in atrisk individual the stubbornness of the problem reflects it complexity and the densely interwoven causal factor underlying it here we focus on one piece of the puzzle how can we identify those who are at risk of taking or attempting to take their own life and how can this screening be used to foster effective intervention assessing an individual risk for suicidal behavior is difficult experienced and talented clinician frequently struggle to correctly interpret signal in their patient behavior that are indicative of suicide risk setting aside the profound difficulty associated with understanding an individual personal history and it relationship to their capacity and motivation for selfharm there are at least practical reason that assessing suicide risk is difficult the latency between the onset of acute risk for suicide and the suicide attempt itself may be too small for intervention requiring contact with health professional and most existing method for detecting high risk of suicide require that individual disclose their wish to harm themselves to a health professional in this article we explore the possibility that digital life datathat is the interaction that a person ha with digital device through the daily course of their life collected passively but with consent might at least partially address each of these difficulty individual come to be at risk for suicide at different temporal interval relative to suicide attempt for instance the kind of social isolation that is frequently associated with suicide can gradually accumulate over the course of a person life or may become acute in a very short period of time after a traumatic life event such a the loss of a loved one moreover once an individual is engaged with a health care professional standard method of suicide intervention require both that the clinician administer a standardized risk assessment often in the form of a questionnaire and that the patient disclose their intention to harm themselves each of these present it own challenge first administering a suicide screening tool may place an unreasonable burden on the health care provider the standard for suicide screening within the health care system is beck scale for suicide ideation a or item questionnaire examining the patient active and passive desire for suicide and any specific plan they might have many patient who are at risk for suicide only interact with primary care physician pcp or emergency department ed rather than those with psychiatric specialty such health care provider may lack the time or the training to administer a specific questionnaire for suicide risk indeed enabling pcp and ed to better screen for suicide risk ha been posited a a method for reducing the suicide rate second patient cannot always be relied upon to disclose suicidal thought in the clinical setting these factor have the potential for a large impact if missed screening opportunity can be capitalized upon of patient attempting suicide visited a mental health professional in the week period prior to their attempt with having visited a health professional of any kind in the same period of time independent of the efficacy and specificity of these scale and instrument for screening for suicide risk they are pragmatically limited in their application to time when a patient is interacting with the health care system the health care professional they are interacting with deems administration of a suicide risk screening a worthy use of time and the patient is willing to disclose suicidal thought plan or action at that time many at risk are not engaged with the health care system at all there are strong correlation of statebased suicide rate with indicator for lack of access to health care ahmedani et al report that of individual attempting suicide had not seen a mental health care practitioner in the prior year and had not seen any health care practitioner in the prior year with significant variation among racial and ethnic group furthermore the health care system seems to have a significant and systematic gap for helping individual after their suicide attempt substance abuse and mental health service administration samhsa survey data from showed that of drugrelated suicide attempt ed admission showed no evidence of followup treatment taken together the existing infrastructure for suicide risk detection and intervention highlight the need for some way of screening individual outside the context of their interaction with the health care system and for detecting signal positively associated with suicidal behavior that are le overt than explicit disclosure the above suggests at least path to improve screening for suicide risk within the existing health care system providing evidence of risk without relying exclusively on self disclosure and the pragmatic reduction of time needed with a health care worker to administer the screening tool and thus reducing the resistance to administering the tool on the part of the health care professional furthermore a model capable of identifying those at risk outside the health care system could be part of a system to funnel them toward appropriate care interestingly there ha been significant progress in using data outside the health care system to ass and understand mental health and wellbeing in recent year which some refer to a digital phenotyping eg onnela and rauch in particular signal related to a person mental health and wellbeing have been extracted from a person digital life digital life generally cover all the interaction that a person ha with digital device through the daily course of their life including social medium data eg facebook instagram twitter reddit data from wearable device eg fitbit jawbone geolocation actigriphy from phone sensor or interaction with smart device eg amazon alexa or other internet of thing iot device for one point of comparison see figure which show one person interaction with the health care system in red hash and post on facebook in blue hash over the course of a few year a growing body of work suggests that various fact about an individual mental health can be inferred from the text that a person generates raising the intriguing possibility that social medium data could be used a a screening andor early detection tool social medium data have been found to contain predictive signal for condition including major depressive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder schizophrenia eating disorder generalized anxiety disorder bipolar disorder selfharm suicide borderline personality disorder and others computational analysis of social medium data may therefore fulfill the desideratum of a screening system that capture an individual behavior outside of their interaction with the health care system and is amenable to the kind of automation and scalability that is often sorely lacking in underfunded and resourceconstrained health care provider this article primary contribution are a follows the creation of an automated model for analysis and estimation of suicide risk from social medium data an examination of how this could be used to improve existing

large and worsening there ha been little progress made over the past year in understanding suicide and improving outcome in atrisk individual the stubbornness of the problem reflects it complexity and the densely interwoven causal factor underlying it here we focus on one piece of the puzzle how can we identify those who are at risk of taking or attempting to take their own life and how can this screening be used to foster effective intervention assessing an individual risk for suicidal behavior is difficult experienced and talented clinician frequently struggle to correctly interpret signal in their patient behavior that are indicative of suicide risk setting aside the profound difficulty associated with understanding an individual personal history and it relationship to their capacity and motivation for selfharm there are at least practical reason that assessing suicide risk is difficult the latency between the onset of acute risk for suicide and the suicide attempt itself may be too small for intervention requiring contact with health professional and most existing method for detecting high risk of suicide require that individual disclose their wish to harm themselves to a health professional in this article we explore the possibility that digital life datathat is the interaction that a person ha with digital device through the daily course of their life collected passively but with consent might at least partially address each of these difficulty individual come to be at risk for suicide at different temporal interval relative to suicide attempt for instance the kind of social isolation that is frequently associated with suicide can gradually accumulate over the course of a person life or may become acute in a very short period of time after a traumatic life event such a the loss of a loved one moreover once an individual is engaged with a health care professional standard method of suicide intervention require both that the clinician administer a standardized risk assessment often in the form of a questionnaire and that the patient disclose their intention to harm themselves each of these present it own challenge first administering a suicide screening tool may place an unreasonable burden on the health care provider the standard for suicide screening within the health care system is beck scale for suicide ideation a or item questionnaire examining the patient active and passive desire for suicide and any specific plan they might have many patient who are at risk for suicide only interact with primary care physician pcp or emergency department ed rather than those with psychiatric specialty such health care provider may lack the time or the training to administer a specific questionnaire for suicide risk indeed enabling pcp and ed to better screen for suicide risk ha been posited a a method for reducing the suicide rate second patient cannot always be relied upon to disclose suicidal thought in the clinical setting these factor have the potential for a large impact if missed screening opportunity can be capitalized upon of patient attempting suicide visited a mental health professional in the week period prior to their attempt with having visited a health professional of any kind in the same period of time independent of the efficacy and specificity of these scale and instrument for screening for suicide risk they are pragmatically limited in their application to time when a patient is interacting with the health care system the health care professional they are interacting with deems administration of a suicide risk screening a worthy use of time and the patient is willing to disclose suicidal thought plan or action at that time many at risk are not engaged with the health care system at all there are strong correlation of statebased suicide rate with indicator for lack of access to health care ahmedani et al report that of individual attempting suicide had not seen a mental health care practitioner in the prior year and had not seen any health care practitioner in the prior year with significant variation among racial and ethnic group furthermore the health care system seems to have a significant and systematic gap for helping individual after their suicide attempt substance abuse and mental health service administration samhsa survey data from showed that of drugrelated suicide attempt ed admission showed no evidence of followup treatment taken together the existing infrastructure for suicide risk detection and intervention highlight the need for some way of screening individual outside the context of their interaction with the health care system and for detecting signal positively associated with suicidal behavior that are le overt than explicit disclosure the above suggests at least path to improve screening for suicide risk within the existing health care system providing evidence of risk without relying exclusively on self disclosure and the pragmatic reduction of time needed with a health care worker to administer the screening tool and thus reducing the resistance to administering the tool on the part of the health care professional furthermore a model capable of identifying those at risk outside the health care system could be part of a system to funnel them toward appropriate care interestingly there ha been significant progress in using data outside the health care system to ass and understand mental health and wellbeing in recent year which some refer to a digital phenotyping eg onnela and rauch in particular signal related to a person mental health and wellbeing have been extracted from a person digital life digital life generally cover all the interaction that a person ha with digital device through the daily course of their life including social medium data eg facebook instagram twitter reddit data from wearable device eg fitbit jawbone geolocation actigriphy from phone sensor or interaction with smart device eg amazon alexa or other internet of thing iot device for one point of comparison see figure which show one person interaction with the health care system in red hash and post on facebook in blue hash over the course of a few year a growing body of work suggests that various fact about an individual mental health can be inferred from the text that a person generates raising the intriguing possibility that social medium data could be used a a screening andor early detection tool social medium data have been found to contain predictive signal for condition including major depressive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder schizophrenia eating disorder generalized anxiety disorder bipolar disorder selfharm suicide borderline personality disorder and others computational analysis of social medium data may therefore fulfill the desideratum of a screening system that capture an individual behavior outside of their interaction with the health care system and is amenable to the kind of automation and scalability that is often sorely lacking in underfunded and resourceconstrained health care provider this article primary contribution are a follows the creation of an automated model for analysis and estimation of suicide risk from social medium data an examination of how this could be used to improve existing screening for suicide risk within the health care system an exploration of the ethical and privacy concern of creating a system for suicide risk screening not currently in

diagnosed user a pool of potential control user wa identified by selecting only those user who had never posted in a subreddit related to mental health and never used a term related to depression or mental health these restriction minimize the likelihood that user with depression are included in the control group in order to prevent the diagnosed user from being easily identified by the usage of specific keywords that are never used by the control user we removed all post by diagnosed user that met either one of the aforementioned condition ie that wa posted in a mental health subreddit or

health subreddits each diagnosed user wa then greedily matched with the control user who had the smallest hellinger distance between the diagnosed user and the control user subreddit post probability

project will study a group of u war veteran who will optin to share their twitter facebook and linkedin post over time there are so far no publicly available result from this study but the group ha recently published the result of a suicide prediction task using text from the clinical note of u war veteran to identify textbased statistically significant signal of suicidality with around accuracy they found clinical note of people who had died through suicide frequently recorded behaviour indicative of fear agitiation and delusion written text ha also been analysed in a number of recent study that have analysed suicide note and developed machine classifier to identify topic and emotion expressed by people who have taken their life many of these paper attempt to classify text at a sentence level which would suggest short string much like those that would be posted to social medium however suicide note are written by people who have accepted suicide and then go on to harm themselves whereas the current research is particularly interested in identifying suicidal thinking or ideation prior to selfharm which may differ from the language used in suicide note additionally handwritten note even at sentence level are not constrained by string length twitter post are limited to character which force author to use short informal language that may differ from the way they would normally express feeling on paper finally social medium data are noisy contain a broad range of topic and language use varies over time these feature arguably make the task of classifying suicidal ideation more complex than it would be in a discrete recording of presuicide thought and feeling in a suicide note a small number of study have investigated the communication of suicidal ideation on

suiciderelated post on social medium and the number of recorded suicide case suicide related post were identified using a set of keywords relating to general concept such a suicide and depression or relating to suicide method analysed the twitter post of a person who had recently died through suicide they studied the post sent in the twentyfour hour prior to death finding an increase in positive emotion though not statistically significant and a change in focus from the self to others a the time of death approached a this wa only a single person study and given the fact the person had attempted to make the post rhyme thereby perhaps using different language to achieve this the author propose larger study of a wider range of twitter post they used the linguistic inquiry and word count liwc software to identify part of speech emotional word and cognitive process among other concept liwc wa also used in a a sampling technique to identify sad twitter post that were subsequently classified using a machine learning into level of distress on an ordinal scale with around accuracy in the bestcase also studying linguistic feature of suicidal ideation used an online panel of young early s twitter user to examine the association between suiciderelated tweet and suicidal behaviour they identified that particular phrase such a want to commit suicide were strongly associated with lifetime suicide attempt the most powerful predictor of future suicide they also noted that other phrase that suggest suicidal intent such a want to die were le strongly associated the variation here could suggest the flippant use of such phrase on social medium when having a bad day hence the additional challenge posed to classification of suicidal ideation on social medium finally used machine learning to classify risky and non risky tweet a defined by human annotator with an accuracy of around they created word list to represent a number of topic and emotion related to suicide finding

behaviour the project will study a group of u war veteran who will optin to share their twitter facebook and linkedin post over time there are so far no publicly available result from this study but the group ha recently published the result of a suicide prediction task using text from the clinical note of u war veteran to identify textbased statistically significant signal of suicidality with around accuracy they found clinical note of people who had died through suicide frequently recorded behaviour indicative of fear agitiation and delusion written text ha also been analysed in a number of recent study that have analysed suicide note and developed machine classifier to identify topic and emotion expressed by people who have taken their life many of these paper attempt to classify text at a sentence level which would suggest short string much like those that would be posted to social medium however suicide note are written by people who have accepted suicide and then go on to harm themselves whereas the current research is particularly interested in identifying suicidal thinking or ideation prior to selfharm which may differ from the language used in suicide note additionally handwritten note even at sentence level are not constrained by string length twitter post are limited to character which force author to use short informal language that may differ from the way they would normally express feeling on paper finally social medium data are noisy contain a broad range of topic and language use varies over time these feature arguably make the task of classifying suicidal ideation more complex than it would be in a discrete recording of presuicide thought and feeling in a suicide note a small number of study have investigated the communication of suicidal ideation on social medium however they are mainly focused on a comparison with national death rate for example in korea and the u research ha attempted to identify a positive correlation

https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14891,10,4,data,"De Choudhury, Kiciman ",2,1,0,0,2017,identifying atrisk individual a a starting point of our data collection we obtained access to a reddit dataset of mental health post from de choudhury et al de choudhury et al this dataset included post from unique user that were shared between february and november on mental health subreddits henceforth referred to a mh and a prominent suicide support community on reddit rsuicidewatch henceforth referred to a sw example mental health subreddits include rdepression rmentalhealth rbipolarreddit rptsd rpsychoticreddit all of these subreddits host public content and have been examined and validated by mental health expert in prior work to be community of mental health and suicidal ideation support de choudhury and de following the method developed in de choudhury et al we constructed two user class table we first seek to identify a set of reddit user who initially say time period post about mental health concern in the mental health subreddits or mh only and would later say time period be observed to post about suicidal ideation in the suicidewatch community or sw we also identify a second set of user for whom we would not have any observation of posting in sw in or despite their posting on the mh subreddits in for the purpose of our investigation we consider to span from feb to aug and t from aug to nov a also considered in de choudhury et al the first set of user thus constitutes the class at risk of suicidal ideation in the future henceforth referred to a mh sw while the latter is the class of user not at risk henceforth referred to a mh we were able to identify user in the mh sw group based on this approach for the mh user to balance our class size going into the ensuing propensity score matching framework we obtained an equal number of user randomly sampled from the user who never posted in sw in t or t a also noted in de choudhury et al a caveat of this approach is that some of these user may have gone on to post on sw outside of the observable period of our dataset ie after t however the large timespan of our data give sufficient confidence in the purity of the class derived commentary data recall the goal of this paper is to ass the role that social support a manifested in social medium may play in an individual risk to suicidal ideation in the future we consider comment made on reddit post of the above identified mh sw and another mh user to be proxy of social support prior work ha situated commentary in online

collection we obtained access to a reddit dataset of mental health post from de choudhury et al de choudhury et al this dataset included post from unique user that were shared between february and november on mental health subreddits henceforth referred to a mh and a prominent suicide support community on reddit rsuicidewatch henceforth referred to a sw example mental health subreddits include rdepression rmentalhealth rbipolarreddit rptsd rpsychoticreddit all of these subreddits host public content and have been examined and validated by mental health expert in prior work to be community of mental health and suicidal ideation support de choudhury and de following the method developed in de choudhury et al we constructed two user class table we first seek to identify a set of reddit user who initially say time period post about mental health concern in the mental health subreddits or mh only and would later say time period be observed to post about suicidal ideation in the suicidewatch community or sw we also identify a second set of user for whom we would not have any observation of posting in sw in or despite their posting on the mh subreddits in for the purpose of our investigation we consider to span from feb to aug and t from aug to nov a also considered in de choudhury et al the first set of user thus constitutes the class at risk of suicidal ideation in the future henceforth referred to a mh sw while the latter is the class of user not at risk henceforth referred to a mh we were able to identify user in the mh sw group based on this approach for the mh user to balance our class size going into the ensuing propensity score matching framework we obtained an equal number of user randomly sampled from the user who never posted in sw in t or t a also noted in de choudhury et al a caveat of this approach is that some of these user may have gone on to post on sw outside of the observable period of our dataset ie after t however the large timespan of our data give sufficient confidence in the purity of the class derived commentary data recall the goal of this paper is to ass the role that social support a manifested in social medium may play in an individual risk to suicidal ideation in the future we consider comment made on reddit post of the above identified mh sw and another mh user to be proxy of social support prior work ha situated

or mh in the future our stratified analysis is comparing a treatment group of user who received a particular comment to a control group of people who did not having indistinguishable distribution of covariates in these two group is very important to ensure that any difference in their likelihood of future posting in sw can be attributed to the fact that one group received the comment and the other group did not however unlike a randomized controlled trial we have no assurance that treatment is independent of unobserved covariates or independent of covariates incorrectly represented from a machine learning perspective in our covariate set this can lead to confounded result therefore ensuring that the stratified group are correctly balanced is critical to correct estimation of outcome ie the likelihood of a user being in mh sw or mh towards this goal in this section we describe an approach to first ass qualitatively the comparability or balance between the treatment and the control group using human judge human judgment of balance are valid in our analysis because it is human commenters who are replying to post and thus deciding whether a user get a treatment or not we then quantitatively measure potential difference in sociolingustic measure and language model between the two group together this approach allows u to identify those subpopulation of treatment and control user who are more likely to be affected by comment on their post in this subsection we present our qualitative approach of assessing balance between treatment and control group belonging to different propensity stratum we first implemented our proposed propensity score matching technique among the mh post and comment of the user in our dataset we identified token that had statistically significant treatment effect negative effect would imply that receiving the comment token decreased chance of being in mh sw and vice versa we randomly sampled token with the most positive or negative zscores for our ensuing qualitative assessment table show a sample of these token thereafter corresponding to each of the selected comment token and spanning different propensity stratum we constructed post pair belonging to the treatment and control user group for each stratum per comment token we randomly select user from the treatment and user from the control group for each of these user we pick their most recent post and all comment they received on that post up until the point of receiving the treatment token or placebo in the case of the control group table give some paraphrased example of post pair thus constructed next we employed two raters an expert in social medium data analysis for mental health and a mental health professional to qualitatively estimate balance in the post pair generated above in other word the raters task wa to identify risk marker of suicidal ideation in the post pair that may not be observable to the propensity score analysis however aligned with known observation of behavior of individual at risk of suicidal ideation in a post pair if the marker aligned we would infer the treatment and control group for that particular comment token and stratum to be balanced if not we would assume that our initial propensity score matching analysis need further tuning to identify more accurately balanced treatment and control group to do so the raters first utilized a codebook of suicidal ideation risk marker developed in de choudhury et al to independently rate a random sample of post pair constructed above to be balanced very similar rating of or imbalanced very dissimilar rating of the risk marker in the codebook were validated in de choudhury et al to align with the cognitive psychological integrative model of suicide dieserud et al they include mention of hopelessness i feel so abandoned anxiety i am feeling panicked impulsiveness right now there only two way to ending it lack of selfesteem i am too ugly to make friend and expression of loneliness i have no one and i never felt such pain following the initial rating exercise followed by resolution of difference the raters rated a larger sample of post pair for balance and imbalance estimation the final agreement wa found to be high cohens an interesting pattern emerged out of the qualitative coding of the post pair figure give a distribution of the balance and imbalance rating over different propensity stratum we observe that the distribution are nearly mirror image of each other that is the balance rating tend to be more frequent among post pair belonging to higher propensity stratum while the imbalance rating peak for pair in the lower propensity stratum the distribution cross each other between stratas and we adopt the lower value a a threshold to identify a set of stratum and corresponding subpopulation of user for which the treatment and control group are balanced propensity stratum we also identify another set where the group and corresponding user subpopulation are not balanced stratum table give some example paraphrased token in our rated sample example stratum corresponding to them and the post pair a can be observed the high propensity stratum post pair exhibit many of the marker of mental health challenge identified in our balance assessment codebook these pair are also semantically similar i have been alone there no way to avoid pain tired of trying and failing feeling like shit but noone to talk to while for the lower propensity stratum post pair only one of the post show these marker of risk to suicidal ideation summarily the example illustrate that our rating that identified post pair of these lower stratum to have greater imbalance the above balance analysis showed that the effect of getting a token in a comment may not be homogeneous certain user may see little effect of getting a token low propensity stratum while others see a large effect higher propensity stratum essentially in what way are the subpopulation of user who fall in the high and low propensity stratum different this is an important consideration in order to understand whether and how user with different characteristic might be le or more likely to be affected by specific token appearing in the comment they receive in their likelihood of being in mh sw in the future to answer this and to give more credence to our qualitative balance assessment we adopted the following quantitative approach specifically we adopt the use of the liwc lexicon chung and pennebaker to quantify the extent to which a variety of sociolinguistic measure are present in the post of the two subpopulation in the high stratum and low propensity stratum stratum let u call them subpopulation h and subpopulation l respectively in table we present the result of our analysis of the subpopulation h and l using the liwc measure our choice of these measure is motivated from prior work where they were used to examine and understand different type of mental health content on social medium de choudhury et al we observe significant difference across the subpopulation a given the diff metricit is the relative percentage difference between the value of a specific measure in the mental health post of subpopulation h and that of subpopulation l the subpopulation h tends to express notably lower anger sadness and na in their post

more limited in it coverage over the population of user in table we report comment token that give the most negative or positive zscores in distinguishing between mh sw and mh user corresponding to

estimated million people of all age suffer from depression depressed people have various depression symptom manifested by distinguishing behavior in clinical diagnosis psychological doctor often make facetoface interview referring to the commonly used diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder criterion nine class of depression symptom are defined in the criterion describing the distinguishing behavior on daily life although this is the most effective method for depression diagnosis people are somehow ashamed or unaware of depression more than of people in the early stage of depression would not consult the psychological doctor deteriorating their condition on the other hand people are increasingly relying on social medium platform like twitter and facebook to disclose emotion and mood a well a share their personal status the user generated content ugc on social medium instantly reflect not only the daily life but also the mental state of user in the past decade social medium were widely used for physical and mental wellness research especially the mental wellness coppersmith et al lin et al akbari et al inspired by these some effort have been dedicated to depression study some researcher asked user to fill questionnaire or participate interview on social medium for example park et al analyzed behavior and the use of language of depressed user on twitter these method are effective but expensive timeconsuming and hard to get sufficient data to guarantee their finding are robust and generalizable besides these questionnaire and interview focus on the depression behavior already defined in depression criterion however the symptom of depression evolve a the world develops especially the online behavior which may not be covered detailedly in the previous depression criterion on the other hand some work considered online behavior on social medium choudhury et al extracted several feature group like engagement and emotion feature to detect depressed user on twitter however these feature group were not regarded a different modality so that the relation across different feature group can hardly be captured without a systematic multimodal framework in this paper we work towards timely depression detection via harvesting social medium this work is nontrival owning to the following challenge a far a we know there is no public available largescale benchmark datasets for depression research that are suitable to our study user behavior on social medium are multifaceted it is hard to characterize the user from discriminant perspective and capture the relation across different modality although user behavior are rich and diverse only a few are symptom of depression so the depressiveoriented feature are sparse on social medium and hard to be captured towards this end we first construct welllabeled depression and non depression datasets on twitter by rulebased heuristic method second to represent each user in our datasets we extract depressionoriented feature inspired not only by the offline symptom from the depression criterion but also online behavior on social medium these feature are composed of six group namely social network feature user profile feature visual feature emotional feature topiclevel feature and domainspecific feature third taking each feature group a a single modality we devise a multimodal depressive dictionary learning model mdl to learn the sparse user representation in addition to the sparse representation this model also considers the relation among the six modality we carry out extensive experiment on the labeled datasets to validate our model to better than baseline in term of fmeasure and analyze the contribution of feature finally we conduct a series of case study to reveal the underlying behavior discrepancy between depressed and nondepressed user on social medium on account of the limited user on welllabeled depression dataset we construct a largescale dataset on twitter and uncover more depressed user by our proposed method in particular we get some statistical finding such a depressed user tend to leak off more emotion on social medium especially negative emotion their negative emotion word are more than those of nondepressed user depressed user tend to post more tweet between and on average more detailed result can be found in section our framework is presented in figure we summarize the main contribution in three aspect we construct benchmark datasets for online depression detection and analysis including the welllabeled depression and nondepression datasets a well a a largescale depressioncandidate dataset in addition we release these datasets with feature to facilitate wellness study for computer science and psychology we extract six group of discriminant depressionoriented feature to describe user from different aspect a only few of the user behavior are symptom of depression we present a multimodal depressive dictionary learning model to learn the sparse representation of user our method can be used to timely detect depression take proactive care to prevent the depressed condition to be deteriorated we analyze feature contribution and online behavior of depression we make our effort to reveal the behavior not covered in depression criterion trying to provide more perspective and insight for depression

depression diagnosis people are somehow ashamed or unaware of depression more than of people in the early stage of depression would not consult the psychological doctor deteriorating their condition on the other hand people are increasingly relying on social medium platform like twitter and facebook to disclose emotion and mood a well a share their personal status the user generated content ugc on social medium instantly reflect not only the daily life but also the mental state of user in the past decade social medium were widely used for physical and mental wellness research especially the mental wellness coppersmith et al lin et al akbari et al inspired by these some effort have been dedicated to depression study some researcher asked user to fill questionnaire or participate interview on social medium for example park et al analyzed behavior and the use of language of depressed user on twitter these method are effective but expensive timeconsuming and hard to get sufficient data to guarantee their finding are robust and generalizable besides these questionnaire and interview focus on the depression behavior already defined in depression criterion however the symptom of depression evolve a the world develops especially the online behavior which may not be covered detailedly in the previous depression criterion on the other hand some work considered online behavior on social medium choudhury et al extracted several feature group like engagement and emotion feature to detect depressed user on twitter however these feature group were not regarded a different modality so that the relation across different feature group can hardly be captured without a systematic multimodal framework in this paper we work towards timely depression detection via harvesting social medium this work is nontrival owning to the following challenge a far a we know there is no public available largescale benchmark datasets for depression research that are suitable to our study user behavior on social medium are multifaceted it is hard to characterize the user from discriminant perspective and capture the relation across different modality although user behavior are rich and diverse only a few are symptom of depression so the depressiveoriented feature are sparse on social medium and hard to be captured towards this end we first construct welllabeled depression and non depression datasets on twitter by rulebased heuristic method second to represent each user in our datasets we extract depressionoriented feature inspired not only by the offline symptom from the depression criterion but also online behavior on social medium these feature are composed of six group namely social network feature user profile feature visual feature emotional feature topiclevel feature and domainspecific feature third taking each feature group a a single modality we devise a multimodal depressive dictionary learning model mdl to learn the sparse user representation in addition to the sparse representation this model also considers the relation among the six modality we carry out extensive experiment on the labeled datasets to validate our model to better than baseline in term of fmeasure and analyze the contribution of feature finally we conduct a series of case study to reveal the underlying behavior discrepancy between depressed and nondepressed user on social medium on account of the limited user on welllabeled depression dataset we construct a largescale dataset on twitter and uncover more depressed user by our proposed method in particular we get some statistical finding such a depressed user tend to leak off more emotion on social medium especially negative emotion their negative emotion word are more than those of nondepressed user depressed user tend to post more tweet between and on average more detailed result can be found in section our framework is presented in figure we summarize the main contribution in three aspect we construct benchmark datasets for online depression detection and analysis including the welllabeled depression and nondepression datasets a well a a largescale depressioncandidate dataset in addition we release these datasets with feature to facilitate wellness study for computer science and psychology we extract six group of discriminant depressionoriented feature to describe user from different aspect a only few of the user behavior are symptom of depression we present a multimodal depressive dictionary learning model to learn the sparse representation of user our method can be used to timely detect depression take proactive care to prevent the depressed condition to be deteriorated we analyze feature contribution and online behavior of depression we make our effort to reveal the behavior not covered in depression criterion trying to provide more perspective and insight for depression

depression detection besides it can be seen that the performance suffers the most from removing the social network modality by indicating that user posting behavior are more discriminative than the content they posted in addition the emotion modality also contributes much to the performance which show the depressed user usually have different emotion status over a long

https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45141,13,9,,"Gkotsis, Oellrich, Hubbard, Dobson, Liakata, Velupillai, Dutta",7,0,0,0,2017,in our study we addressed the problem of characterising and automatically classifying usergenerated content on the social medium platform reddit for the case of mental health condition we manually investigated data originating from several subreddits to group the post into overarching theme the derived grouping of post into theme wa further evaluated by applying topic detection algorithm and result suggested that the themebased grouping wa valid we then applied two classification strategy a binary classification to determine whether or not a post contains mental health related content and multiclass classification to identify the mental health condition theme a post is referring to our result show that by applying a cnn approach in the binary classification task we achieve an accuracy of in distinguising the mental health related post from unrelated post further to that we can identify reddit post a belonging to one of the defined theme with an overall weighted precision of and a recall of fm taken in conjunction these result suggest that we can reliably identify mental health content and determine the mental health theme that is further referred to in the post assuming that there is sufficient data for disorder to train the model on in our approach we assessed post from several subreddits that were grouped into theme despite the manual and automated verification of the generated theme there is an intrinsic overlap of post content across the theme due to the relatedness of mental health condition for example a can be seen from the confusion matrix in fig a large number of opiate post are misclassified a cripplingalcoholism and vice versa both theme refer to a substance addiction indicating shared language feature to a larger degree than with other subreddits furthermore it is worth noting that both subreddits contain strong language that is not a clearly represented in any of the other subreddits and both subreddits allow for post that embrace addiction similarly a high rate of post are misclassified between the selfharm and suicidewatch subreddits both of which feature behaviour associated with mental and emotional distress we chose to use topic modelling a a mean of automatically obtaining key characteristic word and phrase from the post a it ha been applied successfully in similar setting in other study eg schwartz et al the topic model shown in supplement each topic is using the most descriptive keywords align with the manually created theme and an extension of this work could be to further optimise the validation approach by scaling the number of topic retrieved with the number of available post in the theme the control group built for the first task see section control dataset generation in method for more detail utilises the author information of user who post on mental healthrelated subreddits we opted for this approach due to the long computation time required for calculating age and gender estimate for individual post and the number of post that need to be matched in general age and gender matching is desired to avoid influence originating from gender or age difference in language use while we used all user posting on mental health subreddits only a subset of author appears in the control dataset around of the user appear in the non mental health subreddits and appear in the mental health subreddits moreover this intersection of usersauthors is responsible for post in the mental health subreddits which corresponds to only of the mental health post see supplement figure s for more detail this may be partially explained by user not wanting to be recognised by other reddit user or peer and therefore disguising their identity by using so called throwaway account hence the result presented here concern case where author between the two class are largely different our study doe not focus on such case where author post simultaneously under both class it ha been demonstrated in the past that characteristic linguistic feature are apparent in those suffering from mental illness this mean that our dataset could have limitation in being applicable to ass linguistic difference between mental health and nonmental health related post a linguistic feature are likely to be present in both the mental health and control post with regard to our result this is likely to increase the difficulty of our classification task a we are aiming to use the content to determine mental health and nonmental health post on the contrary if we were to create a control group that is entirely unrelated it is possible that our performance measure currently bestperforming accuracy for cnn might increase concerning the classification task and the deep learning approach presented we experimented with different setting and threshold we considered pretrained word vector a input to the classifier eg using glove common crawl containing billion token but the result did not improve we attribute this to the size of our dataset which is adequate for representing the language within the corpus furthermore we experimented with increasing the complexity of our network in different part such a the dimension of the input vector the overall topology of the network a well a different activation and objective function in all the configuration experimented with the accuracy of the classification did not improve which is why we kept the simplest configuration our result for the multiclass classification are satisfactory and provide some interesting insight there is some variability in classlevel result for instance for opiate fm is a high a while for addiction result are lower when studying the confusion matrix fig the most common misclassification is depression for which there are two main explanation the first reason is that depression is the most populous class so the training of the classifier may have resulted in a bias favouring this class the second reason is that depression is often a secondary symptom of other mental health problem and show considerable comorbidity with other mental health disorder this is also confirmed through our manual survey of the content of the post see section manual characterisation of subreddits where it wa found that post from different theme may also concern depression and where post in the depression subreddit may be related to more than just depression to further support the above we conducted an experiment whereby we removed the most prevalent classtheme depression which account for of the post and repeated the same multiclass classification task contrary to the typical behaviour in such setting the removal of the most prevalent class resulted in an increase in the accuracy more specifically all classifier improved and cnn performs the best with accuracy more than improvement this finding further support the notion that the class in our problem are neither orthogonal nor mutually exclusive in nature when considering a le strict evaluation metric ie instead of truefalse a in classification task such a mean reciprocal rank ie the position at which a theme ranked compared to the actual class the result improve significantly more than across all classifier this finding also highlight the fact that some of the theme are highly interrelated and not always distinguishable a separate and exclusive class for example a common symptom of depression is suicidal ideation which in consequence mean that a person posting on depression may express suicidal thought which are the content of communication on suicidewatch concerning the binary classification task we notice that the simple ff network achieves similar performance to the more sophisticated cnn le than drop in accuracy concluding that the binary classification problem is captured sufficiently using a more simple neural network one limitation of our approach is the number of mental health theme that are used in the multiclass classification task in order to cover more theme our model built for the multiclass classification would require additional data however the way the approach is implemented more theme can be added over time and the only cost is that the prediction model need to be retrained and performance reassessed in conclusion our suggested method is applicable to the identification of post relevant to a mental health subreddit a well a the identification of the actual mental health theme they relate to being able to classify post in this manner is the first step in the direction of targeted intervention eg by redirecting post that seem in need of urgent moderator attention in future work we aim to further improve the classification into mental health theme multiclass classification address interrelated theme eg by employing hierarchical structure increase the coverage of mental health theme and devise an urgency scheme to come closer to the aforementioned notification system in the frame of realtime personalised intervention,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0,0,0,0,0,,0,in our study we addressed the problem of characterising and automatically classifying usergenerated content on the social medium platform reddit for the case of mental health condition we manually investigated data originating from several subreddits to group the post into overarching theme the derived grouping of post into theme wa further evaluated by applying topic detection algorithm and result suggested that the themebased grouping wa valid we then applied two classification strategy a binary classification to determine whether or not a post contains mental health related content and multiclass classification to identify the mental health condition theme a post is referring to our result show that by applying a cnn approach in the binary classification task we achieve an accuracy of in distinguising the mental health related post from unrelated post further to that we can identify reddit post a belonging to one of the defined theme with an overall weighted precision of and a recall of fm taken in conjunction these result suggest that we can reliably identify mental health content and determine the mental health theme that is further referred to in the post assuming that there is sufficient data for disorder to train the model on in our approach we assessed post from several subreddits that were grouped into theme despite the manual and automated verification of the generated theme there is an intrinsic overlap of post content across the theme due to the relatedness of mental health condition for example a can be seen from the confusion matrix in fig a large number of opiate post are misclassified a cripplingalcoholism and vice versa both theme refer to a substance addiction indicating shared language feature to a larger degree than with other subreddits furthermore it is worth noting that both subreddits contain strong language that is not a clearly represented in any of the other subreddits and both subreddits allow for post that embrace addiction similarly a high rate of post are misclassified between the selfharm and suicidewatch subreddits both of which feature behaviour associated with mental and emotional distress we chose to use topic modelling a a mean of automatically obtaining key characteristic word and phrase from the post a it ha been applied successfully in similar setting in other study eg schwartz et al the topic model shown in supplement each topic is using the most descriptive keywords align with the manually created theme and an extension of this work could be to further optimise the validation approach by scaling the number of topic retrieved with the number of available post in the theme the control group built for the first task see section control dataset generation in method for more detail utilises the author information of user who post on mental healthrelated subreddits we opted for this approach due to the long computation time required for calculating age and gender estimate for individual post and the number of post that need to be matched in general age and gender matching is desired to avoid influence originating from gender or age difference in language use while we used all user posting on mental health subreddits only a subset of author appears in the control dataset around of the user appear in the non mental health subreddits and appear in the mental health subreddits moreover this intersection of usersauthors is responsible for post in the mental health subreddits which corresponds to only of the mental health post see supplement figure s for more detail this may be partially explained by user not wanting to be recognised by other reddit user or peer and therefore disguising their identity by using so called throwaway account hence the result presented here concern case where author between the two class are largely different our study doe not focus on such case where author post simultaneously under both class it ha been demonstrated in the past that characteristic linguistic feature are apparent in those suffering from mental illness this mean that our dataset could have limitation in being applicable to ass linguistic difference between mental health and nonmental health related post a linguistic feature are likely to be present in both the mental health and control post with regard to our result this is likely to increase the difficulty of our classification task a we are aiming to use the content to determine mental health and nonmental health post on the contrary if we were to create a control group that is entirely unrelated it is possible that our performance measure currently bestperforming accuracy for cnn might increase concerning the classification task and the deep learning approach presented we experimented with different setting and threshold we considered pretrained word vector a input to the classifier eg using glove common crawl containing billion token but the result did not improve we attribute this to the size of our dataset which is adequate for representing the language within the corpus furthermore we experimented with increasing the complexity of our network in different part such a the dimension of the input vector the overall topology of the network a well a different activation and objective function in all the configuration experimented with the accuracy of the classification did not improve which is why we kept the simplest configuration our result for the multiclass classification are satisfactory and provide some interesting insight there is some variability in classlevel result for instance for opiate fm is a high a while for addiction result are lower when studying the confusion matrix fig the most common misclassification is depression for which there are two main explanation the first reason is that depression is the most populous class so the training of the classifier may have resulted in a bias favouring this class the second reason is that depression is often a secondary symptom of other mental health problem and show considerable comorbidity with other mental health disorder this is also confirmed through our manual survey of the content of the post see section manual characterisation of subreddits where it wa found that post from different theme may also concern depression and where post in the depression subreddit may be related to more than just depression to further support the above we conducted an experiment whereby we removed the most prevalent classtheme depression which account for of the post and repeated the same multiclass classification task contrary to the typical behaviour in such setting the removal of the most prevalent class resulted in an increase in the accuracy more specifically all classifier improved and cnn performs the best with accuracy more than improvement this finding further support the notion that the class in our problem are neither orthogonal nor mutually exclusive in nature when considering a le strict evaluation metric ie instead of truefalse a in classification task such a mean reciprocal rank ie the position at which a theme ranked compared to the actual class the result improve significantly more than across all classifier this finding also highlight the fact that some of the theme are highly interrelated and not always distinguishable a separate and exclusive class for example a common symptom of depression is suicidal ideation which in consequence mean that a person posting on depression may express suicidal thought which are the content of communication on suicidewatch concerning the binary classification task we notice that the simple ff network achieves similar performance to the more sophisticated cnn le than drop in accuracy concluding that the binary classification problem is captured sufficiently using a more simple neural network one limitation of our approach is the number of mental health theme that are used in the multiclass classification task in order to cover more theme our model built for the multiclass classification would require additional data however the way the approach is implemented more theme can be added over time and the only cost is that the prediction model need to be retrained and performance reassessed in conclusion our suggested method is applicable to the identification of post relevant to a mental health subreddit a well a the identification of the actual mental health theme they relate to being able to classify post in this manner is the first step in the direction of targeted intervention eg by redirecting post that seem in need of urgent moderator attention in future work we aim to further improve the classification into mental health theme multiclass classification address interrelated theme eg by employing hierarchical structure increase the coverage of mental health theme and devise an urgency scheme to come closer to the

diagnostic signal one notable example from literature consists of public selfreports of mental illness made by individual in their social medium feed this paper posit a significant challenge in using these proxy diagnostic signal revolving around their lack of clinical grounding theoretical contextualization and psychometric validityconcerns noted by psychiatrist and computational researcher alike in other word drawing on boyd and crawford critique despite gain in scale gap exist in our understanding of how these signal are defined where their theoretical underpinnings are whether they objectively and accurately measure what they claim to measure that is the clinical mental illness diagnosis and whether the pattern of behavior they exemplify are truly representative of the behavior of patient more generally our position is situated in criticism in the broader social medium research area where the use of online data removed from the individual and the specific offline context and collected without their direct involvement pose natural challenge to evaluation our contribution toward addressing the above methodological gap this paper present a first empirical study to ass the quality of different social mediaderived proxy diagnostic signal in predicting clinical diagnosis of mental illness for treatment and patientprovider intervention focusing on the specific mental illness of schizophrenia and drawing upon an involved partnership between hci and clinical researcher we consider three proxy signal widely used in prior literature behavior signaling affiliation to mental health resource selfreported diagnosis and clinically appraised selfreports of diagnosis adopting data triangulation and modern validity theory a methodological foundation we examine their predictive validity internal and external to do so we design a prediction task to distinguish those with schizophrenia from control population and leverage a carefullycurated social medium dataset of clinically diagnosed schizophrenia patient seeking treatment at a large healthcare organization we find that although the three diagnostic signal demonstrate strong internal validity reproducing what wa established by the original work they perform poorly on the clinically diagnosed patient data thus suffering from poor external validity among the three signal we find that the model that us affiliation behavior a gold standard lead to the poorest performance our result also reveal that incorporating clinical judgment via appraisal of social medium selfreports of mental illness lead to the best performance among the proxy signal when tested on clinical patient data however we find that all classifier trained with the proxy diagnostic signal perform significantly poorly when compared to a model built using the data of the schizophrenia patient population a deep dive in the performance of these classifier via an error analysis reveals several methodological gap in the way these diagnostic signal are conceived and employed in the predictive framework these gap range from uncertainty in the construct validity of the proxy signal and poor theoretical grounding to a variety of

clinician researcher have noted such data acquisition effort to not scale easily and quickly to large and diverse population consequently researcher have operationalized a variety of online behavior a diagnostic signal to build machine learning approach that predict mental illness diagnosis these proxy are easily accessible and inexpensively gathered from social medium without the need to directly engage with the individual themselveswe define binary indicator of the presence or absence of these social medium behavior that might correspond to their clinical mental health state a proxy diagnostic signal one notable example from literature consists of public selfreports of mental illness made by individual in their social medium feed this paper posit a significant challenge in using these proxy diagnostic signal revolving around their lack of clinical grounding theoretical contextualization and psychometric validityconcerns noted by psychiatrist and computational researcher alike in other word drawing on boyd and crawford critique despite gain in scale gap exist in our understanding of how these signal are defined where their theoretical underpinnings are whether they objectively and accurately measure what they claim to measure that is the clinical mental illness diagnosis and whether the pattern of behavior they exemplify are truly representative of the behavior of patient more generally our position is situated in criticism in the broader social medium research area where the use of online data removed from the individual and the specific offline context and collected without their direct involvement pose natural challenge to evaluation our contribution toward addressing the above methodological gap this paper present a first empirical study to ass the quality of different social mediaderived proxy diagnostic signal in predicting clinical diagnosis of mental illness for treatment and patientprovider intervention focusing on the specific mental illness of schizophrenia and drawing upon an involved partnership between hci and clinical researcher we consider three proxy signal widely used in prior literature behavior signaling affiliation to mental health resource selfreported diagnosis and clinically appraised selfreports of diagnosis adopting data triangulation and modern validity theory a methodological foundation we examine their predictive validity internal and external to do so we design a prediction task to distinguish those with schizophrenia from control population and leverage a carefullycurated social medium dataset of clinically diagnosed schizophrenia patient seeking treatment at a large healthcare organization we find that although the three diagnostic signal demonstrate strong internal validity reproducing what wa established by the original work they perform poorly on the clinically diagnosed patient data thus suffering from poor external validity among the three signal we find that the model that us affiliation behavior a gold standard lead to the poorest performance our result also reveal that incorporating clinical judgment via appraisal of social medium selfreports of mental illness lead to the best performance among the proxy signal when tested on clinical patient data however we find that all classifier trained with the proxy diagnostic signal perform significantly poorly when compared to a model built using the data of the schizophrenia patient population a deep dive in the performance of these classifier via an error analysis reveals several methodological gap in the way these diagnostic signal are conceived and employed in the predictive framework these gap range from uncertainty in the construct validity of the proxy signal and poor theoretical grounding to a variety of population and data sampling bias our finding provide remedial guideline for researcher engaging with prediction of mental health state from social medium data and for clinician and practitioner interested in incorporating such machine learning based diagnostic assessment in clinical decisionmaking,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0383647798742138,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.2647798742138365,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.4345911949685535,0.0383647798742138,0.0761006289308176,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.1138364779874213,0.0194968553459119,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629,0.0006289308176100629

medium activity of those who are under formal care and those who are not might be considerably different data sampling bias the observed dataset shift between the proxy datasets and the schizophrenia patient datamay also be stemming from a type of sampling bias related to boundary regulation preference of the individual and the use of public versus private account individual identified using these online diagnostic signal have largely public social medium account however the clinically diagnosed patient we considered largely had private account this difference in boundary regulation and privacy choice between the schizophrenia patient and the individual captured via the diagnostic signal might lead to sampling bias in the proxy datasets identifying and quantifying the bias between the

proxy diagnostic signal in this paper although they are amongst the most widely used in the community future work can also present additional investigation on alternative proxy signal and the potential of employing the use of multiple proxy signal in a concerted fashion notwithstanding these limitation there is a key takeaway in this paper that if the broader research agenda is to use social medium data toinform clinical decisionmaking such a early diagnosis treatment or patientprovider intervention using patient data to build machine learning model is imperative that said the goal of this paper is not to be dismissive of the immense potential thatliesin this source of data to quoteinkster and colleague while acknowledging that issue are far from settledabout the role that socialmedia shouldplayinmental health we argue that it should no longer be a debate about whether researcher and healthcare provider engage with social networking site but rather how best to utilize this technology to promote positive change our remedial guideline attempt to chart some of these possible way of using social medium data for positive change in mental healthby pairing offline and online patient data a well a by meaningfully involving researcher clinician and patient it is possible to extend social medium based approach for early diagnosis treatment and for developing novel patientprovider intervention in closing we recognize that the use of proxy diagnostic signal is attractive because of scalability a well a the low effort and minimal researcher clinician and patient burden they pose however for the limitation both methodological and clinical discovered in this paper we suggest exercising caution and rigor going forward and be cognizant of their implication for key stakeholder like clinician and patient research in the hci field ha been instrumental in surfacing the many challenge of transplanting algorithm built with biased data lacking theoretical and

proxy diagnostic signal in this paper although they are amongst the most widely used in the community future work can also present additional investigation on alternative proxy signal and the potential of employing the use of multiple proxy signal in a concerted fashion notwithstanding these limitation there is a key takeaway in this paper that if the broader research agenda is to use social medium data toinform clinical decisionmaking such a early diagnosis treatment or patientprovider intervention using patient data to build machine learning model is imperative that said the goal of this paper is not to be dismissive of the immense potential thatliesin this source of data to quoteinkster and colleague while acknowledging that issue are far from settledabout the role that socialmedia shouldplayinmental health we argue that it should no longer be a debate about whether researcher and healthcare provider engage with social networking site but rather how best to utilize this technology to promote positive change our remedial guideline attempt to chart some of these possible way of using social medium data for positive change in mental healthby pairing offline and online patient data a well a by meaningfully involving researcher clinician and patient it is possible to extend social medium based approach for early diagnosis treatment and for developing novel patientprovider intervention in closing we recognize that the use of proxy diagnostic signal is attractive because of scalability a well a the low effort and minimal researcher clinician and patient burden they pose however for the limitation both methodological and clinical discovered in this paper we suggest exercising caution and rigor going forward and be cognizant of their implication for key stakeholder like clinician and patient research in the hci field ha been instrumental in surfacing the many challenge of transplanting algorithm built with biased data lacking theoretical and domainspecific validity in realworld context we believe the remedial guideline we proposed will augment these effort by starting conversation in the broader research community interested in leveraging social medium data and machine learning predictive technique to revolutionize mental

feature to classify depression in usergenerated content at messagelevel individuallevel or communitylevel the recent emergence of photosharing platform such a instagram ha attracted researcher attention to study individual behavior from their visual narrativesranging from mining their emotion and happiness trend to studying medical concern researcher have shown that people use instagram to engage in social exchange and share their difficult experience the role of visual imagery a a mechanism of selfdisclosure by relating visual attribute to mental health disclosure on instagram wa highlighted by where individual instagram profile were utilized to build a prediction framework for identifying marker of depression the importance of data modality to understand user behavior on social medium ha been highlighted by more recently a deep neural network sequence modeling approach that marries audio and text data modality to analyze questionanswer style interview between an individual and an agent ha been developed to study mental health similarly a multimodal depressive dictionary learning process wa proposed to detect depressed user on twitter they provide sparse user representation by defining a feature set consisting of social network feature user profile feature visual feature emotional feature topiclevel feature and domainspecific feature particularly our choice to develop a multimodal prediction framework is intended to improve upon previous work involving the use of image in multimodal depression analysis and prior work on studying instagram

and their audience in term of content sharing we begin by employing topic modeling on twitter timeline of our disclosers after preprocessing the tweet to remove url and stopwords we run latent dirichlet allocation using mallet machine learning for language toolkit we perform hyperparameter optimization over the sampling iteration to extract topic using the topic model we compute the topic distribution via posterior probability for each tweet next to identify semantically interpretable broader theme from the topic we employed qualitative labeling two human raters who were social medium and mental health expert performed semiopen coding on the extracted topic collaboratively drawing from their experience studying selfdisclosures of schizophrenia the raters built a set of topical descriptor for each topic by analyzing the top contributing keywords per topic then they combined the lda topic into semantically interpretable broader theme and also labeled whether or not each theme wa related to the diagnosis and experience of schizophrenia finally to inspect the disclosers data over time we used the theme annotation and computed zscores of the average probability of each theme per day across all disclosers since zscores reveal relative difference in the value of a distribution it qualifies a a suitable metric to study variation over time characterizing engagement content using the same topic modeling and qualitative theme annotation approach a above we characterized the engagement content ie dataset of the mention tweet corresponding to each discloser first we built an lda model to obtain topic from the linguistic content of these mention tweet then we computed the topic distribution for each tweet in the mention dataset next we employed a qualitative labeling method to identify interpretable broader theme from these lda generated topic in the engagement content the same two raters a above were employed to analyze the top keywords per topic and come up with topical descriptor for each topic including annotation on whether or not each theme wa related to the disclosure and experience of schizophrenia we again used the zscores of the average probability of each theme per day across all disclosers to identify themespecific variation in the engagement content over time characterizing engagement marker to characterize the engagement marker we use the dataset of retweets favorite and mention received by each discloser per day during the one year period following day of disclosure for each day d ranging from d to d we find the average number of retweets favorite and mention received by all the disclosers and transform the average value into zscores this transformation give u the variation in engagement marker received by the disclosers a a function of time and allows relative comparison we obtain three time series one for retweets favorite and mention from this step discovering pattern of audience engagement to study the variation in engagement indicator marker and content with respect to that in disclosers data we make the following categorization based on the thematic annotation over disclosers data and their corresponding engagement content we categorize the theme label into theme related to the diagnosis and experience of schizophrenia and those unrelated for both theme category we adopt time series comparison technique eg the cross correlation measure to understand how the zscore distribution of the engagement marker and the theme of the engagement content vary with the disclosers theme distribution over

we present result from the thematic annotation on audience engagement content and discus them in the context of the theme derived from disclosers data ref table this juxtaposition of theme help u understand the audience response with respect to what the disclosers are sharing on twitter first among the engagement content theme that relate to experience of schizophrenia we begin by considering the theme mental health supportstigma mhss that also surface in the disclosers data for instance we notice the usage of word such a hcsmca pndhour awareness issue referring to online community dedicated to exchange around health care mental illness and spreading awareness the same theme also includes overlapping word like depression anxiety med mental health pain relating to the stigma and challenge around experience of schizophrenia this show that the audience in response to the schizophrenia content of the disclosers share their experience and resource related to mental health care providing solidarity next we consider another common schizophrenia related theme functioning we observe overlapping keywords such a people life good work money job love sleep relatedly we also find the theme appearance word hair wear red clothes arm softly that surface in the tweet of both the disclosers and their audience taken together these theme relate to the everyday experience capturing behavior around the social emotional physical and cognitive aspect of life their cooccurrence a theme reflects the utility of engagement content a a mechanism to converse about everyday aspect of life communicate plan and exchange thought and idea next we consider the theme emotion that appears in the engagement content with word like love happy good hope lovely miss sweet beautiful while this theme is also present in disclosers data we note a higher prevalence of emotional content in the engagement content than that of the disclosers based on the number of topic contributing towards the theme this particular imbalanced overlap characterizes the emotional support provisioning nature of the engagement that the disclosers gather from their audience a form of support found in the literature to be key to improved mental health state and in supporting therapeutic outcome from disclosure of stigmatized condition de choudhury et al lastly we find an overlap between the audience and the disclosers in the theme sexuality containing term such a girl man guy he shes cute fuck sex this indicates a tendency of the disclosers and in response their audience to open up about deeply personal aspect of their private life that are usually not revealed publicly nevertheless despite the thematic reciprocity noted above we note a sharp distinction between the tweet of the disclosers and audienceshown by the theme symptom in the case of the disclosers this theme rparanormal rcreepy ufo reveals a predominant occurrence of word that have symptomatic relevance to schizophrenia we do not observe such pattern in the theme extracted from the audience engagement content this indicates that although the disclosers are sharing their first person experience of the illness the audience do not respond with similar personal account this brings to light the distinction in broadcasting disclosure on platform like twitter where unlike support community the audience need not necessarily consist of peer undergoing similar experience by juxtaposing the thematic annotation from the disclosers and their audience we find evidence of reciprocal conversation around shared theme related to experience of schizophrenia we situate this discussion in the social penetration theory that give a distinctive emphasis to selfdisclosing behavior being maintained by the gradual overlapping and exploration of their mutual self by party to a relationship sprecher et al pattern of change in the engagement content here we are interested in the questionhow do the above schizophrenia related and other theme from the disclosers and the audience covary over time inspecting figure ad we observe that there is a close temporal alignment between the disclosers and the audience theme relating to schizophrenia experience specifically by analyzing the cross correlation between the two we find that the highest correlation of between the two time series occurs at a negative lag of this positive correlation at a negative lag provides indication of reciprocity in the disclosure processas the disclosers increasingly talk about their schizophrenia experience at time t in day it correlate with the audience talking about similar theme related to these experience at t reciprocity ha been identified a a major norm in selfdisclosure research jiang bazarova and hancock in contrast we find that a the disclosers increasingly talk about their experience the audience begin limiting post on other unrelated topic in the future maximum correlation of at a negative lag of pattern of change in the engagement marker we ask the questionhow doe the audience with the help of various platform functionality respond to disclosers and how do different engagement marker covary with disclosers theme figure a show the zscore distribution of these marker over time we observe two finding first beginning at the day of disclosure there is a peak in mention indicating an increase in incoming engagement from the audience however there is lowered audience engagement during this early period through retweets and favorite this could indicate that the audience find the disclosers content out of place and take time to modulate their engagement around it second there is a very close alignment between the temporal variation in retweets and favorite received from the audience this may be attributable to the similar functionality between both action ie they both indicate some form of acknowledgement or endorsement and have a lower barrier for content production at the click of a button compared to mention which have a higher barrier to content production requiring consciously drafted reply next in figure ej we present an analysis of the temporal variation in the three engagement marker in relation to the disclosers themesboth the schizophrenia related one a well a the rest upon visual inspection we notice that the alignment between the daily measurement of engagement marker is higher with disclosers data related to schizophrenia experience a compared to other unrelated content for the time series representing thematic variation in schizophrenia related experience the maximum correlation with retweets and favorite is observed at cross correlation lag of respectively the negative correlation at a positive lag denotes that a the disclosers increasingly talk about their condition and experience it correlate to receiving fewer retweets and favorite in the day following this is likely explained by the perception that the action of retweet or favorite signal information sharing intention and do not convey an appropriate response to stigmatized disclosure on the other hand we observe a stronger alignment between the disclosure content related to experience of schizophrenia and the mention received the correlation of disclosure related content with mention is the strongest with a lag with a positive value of this show that a the disclosers increasingly talk

mean and derive a score according to the most ptsdlike period the user ha this is done by ordering these binary decision by the time the tweet wa authored selecting a window of tweet and calculating the proportion of those tweet classified a ptsdlike we then slide this window one tweet further removing the oldest tweet and adding in the next in the user timeline and calculate the proportion again the highest this rollingwindow mean achieves will be referred to a the maximum local mean we combine these score to yield the classifier score overall mean maximum local mean capturing how ptsdlike the user is over all time and how ptsdlike they are at their most severe we estimated the performance of our classifier for each condition on distinguishing user with a mental health condition from their community control via fold crossvalidation this differs only slightly from standard crossfold validation in that our observation are paired we maintain this pairing when assigning fold each mental health condition user and their matched control are in the same fold to ass performance we could draw a line a threshold in the ranked list and classify all user above that line a having the mental health condition and all user below that line a control those with the condition above the line would be correctly classified hit while those control above the line would be incorrectly classified false alarm figure show performance of this classifier a receiver operating characteristic roc curve a we adjust this threshold one curve per mental health condition the xaxis show the proportion of false alarm and the yaxis show the proportion of true hit all our classifier are better than chance but far from perfect to aid interpretation table show precision at false alarm performance for most condition is reasonable except seasonal affective disorder which is very difficult a wa reported by coppersmith et al a anxiety and eating disorder have much better performance than the other condition most importantly though for all condition including seasonal affective disorder we are able to identify language usage difference from control

that searching larger phrase and key word may return view people express in conversation and this may be more representative of public opinion a further limitation of both these study is that only one mental and one physical health condition were compared diminishing the opportunity to observe trend both within and between mental and physical health problem in this study we ass the prevalence of both stigmatising and trivialising attitude in a great number of message from a large social medium platform ie twitter we are aiming to contrast attitude within different mental health condition a well a between different mental and physical health condition we also conduct a qualitative analysis on stigmatising and trivialising tweet to highlight specific content and

other strength of this study compared to previous research in this field were the large population size comprehensive tweet collection and the random sampling method which ensured a representative

condition were more likely to be discussed through opinion rather than factual discourse and tweet in the opinion theme were more likely to be stigmatising while physical health condition were more likely to be discussed via informative tweet see fig we think this is notable a it reaffirms the idea that stigma is often driven by misinformed opinion and concerted campaign to increase the

everyday challenge associated with these condition is relatively limited especially when compared with many physical condition one of the most studied deficit related to everyday challenge for individual suffering from depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is language impairment researcher of these mental disorder have long suspected language impairment because of deficit in frontal lobe functioning which control both emotion regulation and language processing language impairment is typically measured through one performance in semantic processing task ie determining semantic relationship between a word phrase or category or differentiating real word from pseudowords based on an individual semantic network and verbal fluency task ie production of word from phonemic or

physical condition one of the most studied deficit related to everyday challenge for individual suffering from depression bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is language impairment researcher of these mental disorder have long suspected language impairment because of deficit in frontal lobe functioning which control both emotion regulation and language processing language impairment is typically measured through one performance in semantic processing task ie determining semantic relationship between a word phrase or category or differentiating real word from pseudowords based on an individual semantic network and verbal fluency task ie production of word from phonemic or semantic category despite the importance of language in everyday life these study do not illustrate daily challenge

level a well a demographic and geographical characteristic could influence the writing quality other than language impairment other possible confounding factor associated with group dynamic and mental health condition include the communication practice and culture of specific subreddits a well a medication and substance use of individual suffering from mental health condition furthermore we assumed that high readability score are reflecting inadequate articulation or organization by writer although inadequate articulation and organization can increase readability score high readability score can also be because of sophisticated language and complex sentence structure however we did not encounter sophisticated writing in our manual assessment and it is unlikely that such sophistication and complexity are highly prevalent in everyday communication similarly we do not know how readability score were influenced by common online communication attribute such a slang abbreviation community nomenclature and misspelling or how lexical diversity wa impacted by number of topic and change of topic however these online communication attribute are more likely to occur in all subreddits and thus affecting the readability score in a similar manner reddit is a widely used platform more frequently used by young male in englishspeaking nation despite more user activity from english speaking nation it is unclear how participation by english a second language speaker is affecting the result additionally member who choose to participate in rdepression rbipolar and rschizophrenia are not necessarily representative of their respective population and are subject to selection bias similarly we do not have any evidence that member of these three mental health subreddits are clinically diagnosed the severity of their condition is unknown and overlapping membership could exist in these subreddits however one of the main limitation of previous study were small sample size which could be the underlying reason for the inconsistent result thus given the size of rdepression rbipolar and rschizophrenia the prevalence and gravity of mental disorder the increasing popularity of social medium and the potential challenge associated with daily use of social medium make reddit an interesting platform to study although beyond the scope of this study further investigation regarding readability metric may be needed for more accurately determining the grade reading level we selected readability metric based on the literature in which the metric have been validated or used however we noticed a disparity among the metric for example readability score by gunning fog index were far greater than the other three metric smog index resulted in readability score that were le than the other metric despite the apparent difference the score were correlated with one another a a previous study suggested and we used the mean of normalized score of four readability metric to strengthen the reliability of our finding due to the consistent statistical result we believe that these four metric can measure the general difficulty of readability we also acknowledge that our large sample size could have inflated the statistical significance level thus we reported ci and used effect size when interpreting the result another interesting future direction would be to investigate why member are improving and longitudinal change in written communication with respect to prolonged participation in online mental health community in this study we only examined the overall impact of participation in online mental health community however understanding how member are improving their written communication skill could potentially inform the design of related patient education program,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0,0,0,0,0,,0,our study ha several limitation a number of confounding factor such a individual premorbidintelligence verbal skill and education level a well a demographic and geographical characteristic could influence the writing quality other than language impairment other possible confounding factor associated with group dynamic and mental health condition include the communication practice and culture of specific subreddits a well a medication and substance use of individual suffering from mental health condition furthermore we assumed that high readability score are reflecting inadequate articulation or organization by writer although inadequate articulation and organization can increase readability score high readability score can also be because of sophisticated language and complex sentence structure however we did not encounter sophisticated writing in our manual assessment and it is unlikely that such sophistication and complexity are highly prevalent in everyday communication similarly we do not know how readability score were influenced by common online communication attribute such a slang abbreviation community nomenclature and misspelling or how lexical diversity wa impacted by number of topic and change of topic however these online communication attribute are more likely to occur in all subreddits and thus affecting the readability score in a similar manner reddit is a widely used platform more frequently used by young male in englishspeaking nation despite more user activity from english speaking nation it is unclear how participation by english a second language speaker is affecting the result additionally member who choose to participate in rdepression rbipolar and rschizophrenia are not necessarily representative of their respective population and are subject to selection bias similarly we do not have any evidence that member of these three mental health subreddits are clinically
