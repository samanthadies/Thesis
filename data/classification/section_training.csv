for depression using photograph posted to instagram our result supported hypothesis that marker of depression are observable in instagram user behavior and hypothesis that these depressive signal are detectable in post made even before the date of first diagnosis human rating proved capable of distinguishing between instagram post made by depressed and healthy individual hypothesis a but showed little or no correlation with most computational feature hypothesis b our finding establish that visual social medium data are amenable to analysis of affect using scalable computational method one

shared by the mh sw and mh user first we establish difference between the two cohort based on our propensity score matching methodology and then present a qualitative interpretation of our quantitative observation propensity score analysis in table we report token with the highest z score that distinguished between mh sw and mh user based on propensity score matching specifically increased the likelihood of a mh account posting in sw in the future based on a particular token used in the past the token reported were all found to be significant at the p level corresponding to each token we also report the absolute number of user in our dataset out of a total of who used the token treatment count the proportion of user in our data who fell into an unclipped stratum of the token population coverage the percent increase in likelihood of posting in sw in the future based on use of the token in the past average treatment effect the z score of the token likelihood of use between the two user class and associated statistic of this difference we find that controlling for historical use of different token in mh content use of token such a depression z useless z suicide z anxiety z no friend z have nothing z kill z and to cry z significantly increase a user likelihood to post in sw in the future for depression this increase is for suicide it is for no friend it is for to cry it is while for kill it is in addition to the token in table we look at effect of pronoun usage i you he she we they and corresponding possessive pronoun and find that the use of i and my have a statistically significant large effect i effect z my effect z the use of rd person female pronoun have some statistically significant effect her effect z she effect z and all other pronoun have effect with lower or no statistical significance broadly use of these token indicate a negative attitude experience of emotional distress and selffocus an observation that aligns with our observation made above related to the measure of interpersonal awareness which are the token that decrease the likelihood of posting in sw in the future we show token with the most negative treatment effect and high zscore value in table use of token like counseling z relationship that z intimate z hope it z i agree z and and enjoy z result in reducing the likelihood of posting in sw in the future by this show a tendency of the user of these token to maintain a positive outlook towards life remain hopeful perhaps of recovery agreeableness and focus on valuing social tie including discussion of treatment or therapy note that the effect of using a token may not be homogeneous certain people may see no effect of using a token while others see a large effect figure explores this for the token depression suicide anxiety suicidal and can t the most significant target word with at least people using the token within each plot we show how the future likelihood to post in sw varies across stratum for people using and not using the target token in the case of depression for example we see that for people with a very low estimated propensity to use the word depression use the word it ha a large effect on their likelihood to post on sw while people who have the highest estimated propensity to use the word depression see no additional change from using the word we see similar variance for suicide while the effect of using the word can t is approximately constant across stratum to investigate deeper into heterogeneous effect we search across all treatment token to find those that at different stratum both increase and decrease the likelihood of posting in sw we find such treatment token unigrams and bigram where there is at least one stratum with a positive effect and one with a

literature,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,our next analysis focus on the content post and comment shared by the mh sw and mh user first we establish difference between the two cohort based on our propensity score matching methodology and then present a qualitative interpretation of our quantitative observation propensity score analysis in table we report token with the highest z score that distinguished between mh sw and mh user based on propensity score matching specifically increased the likelihood of a mh account posting in sw in the future based on a particular token used in the past the token reported were all found to be significant at the p level corresponding to each token we also report the absolute number of user in our dataset out of a total of who used the token treatment count the proportion of user in our data who fell into an unclipped stratum of the token population coverage the percent increase in likelihood of posting in sw in the future based on use of the token in the past average treatment effect the z score of the token likelihood of use between the two user class and associated statistic of this difference we find that controlling for historical use of different token in mh content use of token such a depression z useless z suicide z anxiety z no friend z have nothing z kill z and to cry z significantly increase a user likelihood to post in sw in the future for depression this increase is for suicide it is for no friend it is for to cry it is while for kill it is in addition to the token in table we look at effect of pronoun usage i you he she we they and corresponding possessive pronoun and find that the use of i and my have a statistically significant large effect i effect z my effect z the use of rd person female pronoun have some statistically significant effect her effect z she effect z and all other pronoun have effect with lower or no statistical significance broadly use of these token indicate a negative attitude experience of emotional distress and selffocus an observation that aligns with our observation made above related to the measure of interpersonal awareness which are the token that decrease the likelihood of posting in sw in the future we show token with the most negative treatment effect and high zscore value in table use of token like counseling z relationship that z intimate z hope it z i agree z and and enjoy z result in reducing the likelihood of posting in sw in the future by this show a tendency of the user of these token to maintain a positive outlook towards life remain hopeful perhaps of recovery agreeableness and focus on valuing social tie including discussion of treatment or therapy note that the effect of using a token may not be homogeneous certain people may see no effect of using a token while others see a large effect figure explores this for the token depression suicide anxiety suicidal and can t the most significant target word with at least people using the token within each plot we show how the future likelihood to post in sw varies across stratum for people using and not using the target token in the case of depression for example we see that for people with a very low estimated propensity to use the word depression use the word it ha a large effect on their likelihood to post on sw while people who have the highest estimated propensity to use the word depression see no additional change from using the word we see similar variance for suicide while the effect of using the word can t is approximately constant across stratum to investigate deeper into heterogeneous effect we search across all treatment token to find those that at different stratum both increase and decrease the likelihood of posting in sw we find such treatment token unigrams and bigram where there is at least one stratum with a positive effect and one with a negative effect p while their effect are significant within the stratum because they have contradictory effect at different stratum these token do not necessarily have large or significant average treatment effect table show a selection of these treatment token along with the effect and the top distinguishing token for those stratum with the most significant positive and negative effect distinguishing token are ranked a the ratio of the frequency of occurrence within the stratum to

necessitates obtaining gold standard label on selfdisclosure in essence ground truth for the purpose two raters familiar with reddit and it mental health community in particular independently rated a small random sample post with equal proportion from mental health and control subreddits for three level of selfdisclosure no selfdisclosure low and high selfdisclosure these three class of selfdisclosure were chosen based on categorization by bak et al in the raters mutually discussed their label thereafter and thus came up with a set of rule for rating the rule were further aligned with observation in prior work per the rule a post that either reveal personal information eg age location gender etc or divulge sensitive or vulnerable thought belief or embarrassingconfessional experience were to be considered to be indicative of high selfdisclosure joinson characterized sensitive disclosure in term of the extent of revealed vulnerability b post about self but not disclosing

around the world a survey conducted by the world health organization who suggests that depression affect million globally among other associated problem depression can lead to suicide and so the high number of people with depression is considered to be a serious problem also in japan depression and suicide are recognized a serious problem an oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development report show that the standardized suicide rate per hundred thousand people in japan is in which is much higher than oecd average of suicide of young people is particularly serious since for year old people in japan the top cause of death is suicide to cope with such a serious problem the government of japan is making strong effort on the care of depression since depression is considered to be a major cause of suicide before depression can be effectively treated it must be recognized in individual the who report that the majority of people who need treatment for depression do not receive it even during visit with primary care physician depression is often unrecognized and undiagnosed a a result many people with depression do not receive adequate treatment hence for the effective treatment of depression in the population it is important that people know how to recognize symptom of depression in themselves and those around them several measure for estimating sign of depression in individual have been proposed in the form of questionnaire among such questionnaire there are many scale for estimating severity of depression the center for epidemiologic study depression scale cesd beck depression scale bdi zungs selfrating depression scale sd and hamilton depression rating scale hdrs are the more popular result on these scale are obtained from answer to the questionnaire either through selfreporting or thirdparty observation these subjective measure are widely used and are expected to achieve high estimation accuracy nevertheless developing technique for recognizing depression in individual by using objective rather than subjective information is important one reason for this is that questionnaire are often costly and sometimes significantly so in contrast a method for recognizing depression in individual by examining objective information such a record of daily activity could be applied for a very low cost in many case a technique to identify symptom of depression in individual from objective information would hasten recognition of depression by individual and thereby allow earlier access to effective treatment a objective information for identifying depression in individual we focus on largescale record of user activity in social medium in recent year social medium ha become increasingly popular and therefore both largescale and finegrained record of user activity are available many researcher are interested in analyzing such largescale data and prior analysis have used those for purpose such a estimating the future movement of stock market index and predicting the result of election since social medium are often used for expressing emotion the record of user activity are a promising source for information that could be used to recognize symptom of depression in the user the use of data from social medium to estimate severity of depression in social medium user ha been studied before for example tsugawa et al found that frequency of word usage in message hereinafter tweet on the popular microblogging service twitter could be used for recognizing depression among user pioneering work by de choudhury et al describes how to construct support vector machine svm classifier that can be used to identify user with depression using feature obtained from the record of individual user activity on twitter that research show the potential for recognizing symptom of depression in a user by examining the user social medium activity the result of prior research suggest that the use of social medium for recognizing depression is a promising approach however research into these technique is just beginning and so extensive evaluation is necessary a an example the sensitivity of result to the period over which a user social medium activity are analyzed is not yet known additionally the generality of the result of should be verified by analyzing other datasets it should be important to share and accumulate the result from several datasets among researcher particularly in such an emerging research field in this paper we extensively evaluate the effectiveness of using a user social medium activity for estimating degree of depression a ground truth data we use the result of a webbased questionnaire for measuring degree of depression this questionnaire wa completed by the twitter user who agreed to participate from these data and user activity history we investigate the relation between feature of each user activity and that user score on the depression questionnaire we construct several model to predict user with depression from the feature of the user activity for this purpose we use svm and investigate the estimation accuracy of the model our main contribution are summarized a follows we show that feature obtained from user activity can be used to predict depression of user with an accuracy of which is similar to the rate in while de choudhury et al use data about englishspeaking user we use data about japanesespeaking user together these result suggest that the use of data from social medium is an effective approach for user with different background here englishspeaking and japanesespeaking user we show the effectiveness of using topic a identified in tweet by a topic model a feature for the svm our result show that applying a simple bagofwords model ie word frequency to tweet result in overfitting but using topic inferred from word frequency prevents overfitting and improves estimation accuracy we investigate the relation between the number of tweet used for estimation and the estimation accuracy we suggest an appropriate amount of tweet for recognizing depression additionally we find that about two month of observation data are necessary for recognizing depression and longer observation period do not contribute to improving the accuracy of estimation for current depression sometimes longer period worsen the

who collected data from englishspeaking user through crowdsourcing this study collected data from japanesespeaking volunteer this approach wa used to investigate the extent to which depression risk can be estimated for a population different from the population considered by the prior research figure show a screenshot of our website the website collected the response to a questionnaire to evaluate the degree of depression of the twitter user who participated hereinafter the participant and to collect the history of participant activity on twitter the activity history of participant were collected through the twitter application programming interface api and the questionnaire to determine degree of depression were completed by participant through their web browser before data collection visitor to the website were presented with a written explanation of the aim of the experiment the information that would be collected and how that information would be handled those who consented to become participant after receiving the explanation logged into their individual twitter account through the oauth authorization process next participant were surveyed on gender age occupation and history of depression following which they answered a questionnaire designed to evaluate degree of depression a message called the kokoro score kokoro is a japanese word meaning heart determined on the basis of answer to the questionnaire and information in the collected tweet wa displayed to participant after completion of the questionnaire fig experiment participant were able to tweet the message displayed which made it possible to promote the website over twitter by wordofmouth in a type of snowball sampling the cesd questionnaire wa used to evaluate the degree of depression in the cesd test participant answered question on a likerttype point scale each answer wa assigned a score of point with the sum of the point from all answer used a the score to estimate likelihood of depression several standard exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression in this research we regarded a score of point or higher a indicating active depression and a score of point or lower a indicating no active depression these are the same value a used in and give a cutoff score of in addition answer to bdi a depression scale used with characteristic similar to cesd were collected to ensure the reliability of data for each participant score were calculated on both scale with poor correlation regarded a indicating unreliable answer the time taken to answer the questionnaire wa also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded after each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on twitter wa collected from twitter by using the api at most tweet were collected for each participant and the number of user following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded tweet published after the questionnaire wa taken were discarded the website wa opened to the public on december at which time the author publicized it on their twitter account between december and february people participated in the experiment after eliminating participant who did not tweet and participant who answered the questionnaire in fewer than second a previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answer set of answer remained only the first set of answer wa used for participant who completed the questionnaire more than once a a result data about experiment participant male female aged to mean year standard deviation year were analyzed the correlation between cesd score and bdi score for these participant were high and there were no participant with uncorrelated score so the data for all participant were used excluded datasets are not discussed any further figure show the histogram of cesd score of participant among the participant resp were

which made it possible to promote the website over twitter by wordofmouth in a type of snowball sampling the cesd questionnaire wa used to evaluate the degree of depression in the cesd test participant answered question on a likerttype point scale each answer wa assigned a score of point with the sum of the point from all answer used a the score to estimate likelihood of depression several standard exist by which to determine the appropriate cutoff score for identifying depression in this research we regarded a score of point or higher a indicating active depression and a score of point or lower a indicating no active depression these are the same value a used in and give a cutoff score of in addition answer to bdi a depression scale used with characteristic similar to cesd were collected to ensure the reliability of data for each participant score were calculated on both scale with poor correlation regarded a indicating unreliable answer the time taken to answer the questionnaire wa also recorded and those completed in too brief a time were excluded after each participant answered the questionnaire the activity history of that participant on twitter wa collected from twitter by using the api at most tweet were collected for each participant and the number of user following the participant and being followed by the participant were recorded tweet published after the questionnaire wa taken were discarded the website wa opened to the public on december at which time the author publicized it on their twitter account between december and february people participated in the experiment after eliminating participant who did not tweet and participant who answered the questionnaire in fewer than second a previously mentioned to ensure the reliability of the questionnaire answer set of answer remained only the first set of answer wa used for participant who completed the questionnaire more than once a a result data about experiment participant male female aged to mean year standard deviation year were analyzed the correlation between cesd score and bdi score for these participant were high and there were no participant with uncorrelated score so the data for all participant were used excluded datasets are not discussed any further figure show the histogram of cesd score of participant among the participant resp were estimated to have resp not have active depression for an incidence of approximately this incidence is similar to that found by de choudhury et al who identified depression in approximately of participant table give statistic on

social medium text moreover the subject word are often missing in japanese text and using pronoun for subject word is sometimes unnatural particularly in twitterlike short and casual text we therefore decided not to include such feature in our model moreover to the best of our knowledge there are no available standard japanese dictionary like anew lexicon and we therefore used a simple list of

choudhury et al successfully identified new mother suffering from postpartum depression based on change in twitter usage and tweet content in a separate analysis de choudhury et al found that depressive signal were observable in tweet made by individual with major depressive disorder in addition de choudhury et al found that increased social isolation measured via facebook data wa predictive of postpartum depression in mother a small number of study have attempted to identify ptsd marker in twitter data this growing literature ha employed progressively more sophisticated method for making intelligent inference about twitter user mental health based on their online activity despite these advance we identified a number of methodological issue in recent report which we have improved upon in the present work a brief review of these modification provide motivation for the result that follow this growing literature ha employed progressively more sophisticated method for making intelligent inference about twitter user mental health based on their online activity despite these advance we identified a number of methodological issue in recent report which we have improved upon in the present work a brief review of these modification provide motivation for the result that follow we chose to use only tweet posted prior to the date of subject first depression diagnosis rather than focus on recent depressive episode for three reason first selfreported information about depressive symptom is often inaccurate by contrast a clinical diagnosis is an explicit event that doe not rely on subjective impression a may be the case with selfreported onset date second individual diagnosed with depression often come to identify with their diagnosis and subsequent choice including how to portray oneself on social medium may be influenced by this identification it is possible that the predictive signal indicated in de choudhury et al were not tracking depressive symptom per se but rather identified purposeful communication choice on the part of depressed twitter user third and most important if we are able to accurately discriminate between depressed and healthy participant using only tweet posted prior to first diagnosis this would support a stronger claim than ha been made previously namely that twitter data are capable not only of detecting depression but can do so before the first diagnosis ha been made while date of first diagnosis provides a more reliable temporal marker than selfreported onset of symptom onset timing is also valuable to researcher and health care professional looking to better understand depression this is especially true regarding the onset of an individual first depressive episode winokur found that over of depression patient experienced first onset at least month prior to diagnosis the month during which individual suffering from depression are undiagnosed and untreated pose a significant health risk given that the change that occur with the first onset of depression may be reflected in social medium data we hypothesized that a computational approach could model the progression of depression without any explicit estimate of onset using only the content of participant tweet we generated a time series model which chart the course of illness in depressed individual and compared this with healthy participant data to our knowledge de choudhury et al represent the stateoftheart in depression screening on twitter and our own work wa informed by their innovative method accordingly we report model accuracy score from de choudhury et al along with our result a a point of comparison all of the above methodological improvement were also applied to our ptsd analysis which used a separate cohort of study participant extant literature on ptsd detection in twitter data differ from our analysis in important way previous research used bulk collection of public tweet and assigned ptsd label to user based on tweet which mentioned a ptsd diagnosis by comparison we communicated directly with participant and excluded any who could not report a specific date on which they received a professional clinical diagnosis our analytical approach incorporated a wide array of metadata feature and semantic measure which were limited or missing entirely from earlier research most importantly previous research focused only on differentiating ptsd user from healthy user without any consideration of timing with respect to the date of traumatic event or diagnosis our model focused specifically on identifying predictive marker of ptsd prior to diagnosis date a well a tracking the course of this disorder over time,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,early effort to detect

first depression diagnosis rather than focus on recent depressive episode for three reason first selfreported information about depressive symptom is often inaccurate by contrast a clinical diagnosis is an explicit event that doe not rely on subjective impression a may be the case with selfreported onset date second individual diagnosed with depression often come to identify with their diagnosis and subsequent choice including how to portray oneself on social medium may be influenced by this identification it is possible that the predictive signal indicated in de choudhury et al were not tracking depressive symptom per se but rather identified purposeful communication choice on the part of depressed twitter user third and most important if we are able to accurately discriminate between depressed and healthy participant using only tweet posted prior to first diagnosis this would support a stronger claim than ha been made previously namely that twitter data are capable not only of detecting depression but can do so before the first diagnosis ha been made while date of first diagnosis provides a more reliable temporal marker than selfreported onset of symptom onset timing is also valuable to researcher and health care professional looking to better understand depression this is especially true regarding the onset of an individual first depressive episode winokur found that over of depression patient experienced first onset at least month prior to diagnosis the month during which individual suffering from depression are undiagnosed and untreated pose a significant health risk given that the change that occur with the first onset of depression may be reflected in social medium data we hypothesized that a computational approach could model the progression of depression without any explicit estimate of onset using only the content of participant tweet we generated a time series model which chart the course of illness in depressed individual and compared this with healthy participant data to our knowledge de choudhury et al represent the stateoftheart in depression screening on twitter and our own work wa informed by their innovative method accordingly we report model accuracy score from de choudhury et al along with our result a a point of comparison all of the above methodological improvement were also applied to our ptsd analysis which used a separate cohort of study participant extant literature on ptsd detection in twitter data differ from our analysis in important way previous research used bulk collection of public tweet and assigned ptsd label to user based on tweet which mentioned a ptsd diagnosis by comparison we communicated directly with participant and excluded any who could not report a specific date on which they received a professional clinical diagnosis our analytical approach incorporated a wide array of metadata feature and semantic measure which were limited or missing entirely from earlier research most importantly previous research focused only on differentiating ptsd user from healthy user without any consideration of timing with respect to the date of traumatic event or diagnosis our model focused specifically on identifying predictive marker of ptsd prior to diagnosis date a well a tracking the course of this disorder over

sad word on average than healthy observation variable name liwcsad then the hmm state with the higher liwcsad estimate is more likely to be the depressed one given that hmm doe track depression ie the latent state generated by hmm map onto depressed and healthy if on the other hand hmmgenerated state are weakly or not at all related to depression there should be no clear alignment between hmm mean and mean in the raw data the same procedure wa applied when fitting an hmm to the ptsd

depression and ptsd based on user twitter data using computational method our finding strongly support the claim that computational method can effectively screen twitter data for indicator of depression and ptsd our method identified these mental health condition earlier and more accurately than the performance of trained health professional and wa more precise than previous computational approach our statespace model portrayed a timeline for depression which is impressively realistic given that it wa generated analyzing only the text of character message in addition hmm identified a rise in probability of ptsd within six month posttrauma compared to the average month delay between trauma event and diagnosis experienced by the individual in our sample word shift provided context for the specific difference in language that shifted happiness score between sample these advance make improvement on existing predictive screening technology a well a contribute novel method for the identification and tracking of mental illness the hmm depression timeline is an intriguing finding and should be treated with both optimism and caution hmm assigned each data point a probability of belonging to two latent statespaces while blind to our actual state of interest a affectedhealthy label were removed from hmm training data considering that the model could have used criterion completely unrelated to mental health to delineate between the two latent class it is noteworthy that the resulting state mean estimate for each variable in both ptsd and depression analysis closely resembled the mean estimate for affected and healthy participant data respectively this add support for the claim that affectedcondition and healthy twitter user data are objectively different in addition to providing justification for the use of hmm assignment a indicator of depressionptsd signal at a given point in time despite this evidence in favor of applying hmm to analyze mental health trajectory hmm is an unsupervised learning procedure and so conclusive hmmbased inference should be approached cautiously and with close attention on validation procedure the diverging trajectory observed in our hmm time series suggest that with careful attention to model validity statespace modeling may be used to identify and track the onset of certain mental illness over time using only twitter data the labmt happiness measure proved to be the most important predictor in our model and wa considerably stronger than anew or liwc happiness indicator this is in line with a series of previous finding which have found labmt measure to be a superior for tracking happiness in twitter data and suggests that future research in this field should incorporate this instrument for more accurate measurement that average tweet word count wa the second most important predictor is intriguing especially a increase in word count were positively associated with depression and ptsd if anything depression is often characterized by reduced communication although word count is distinct from posting frequency which wa not a significant predictor in our model the current depression and ptsd literature are largely devoid of study relating verbosity to these condition and so this finding may motivate new inquiry into behavioral trait of mental health disorder a observed on social medium from a practical standpoint our model showed considerable improvement over the ability of unassisted general practitioner to correctly diagnose depression and ptsd despite the imprecise nature of this comparison given the paucity of data currently available to serve a benchmark for the type of analysis performed in the present study our model relative success seems encouraging health care provider may be able to improve quality of care and better identify individual in need of treatment based on the simple lowcost method outlined in this report especially given that mental health service are unavailable or underfunded in many country this computational approach which only requires patient digital consent to share their social medium history may open avenue to care which are currently difficult or impossible to provide future investigation would use the same participant pool to collect both health professional assessment a well a computational model of participant social medium behavior to allow for more precise comparison the present finding may be limited by the nonspecific use of the term depression in participant survey while earlier research identified depression predictor in twitter data for major depressive disorder and postpartum depression we used a more general category in our recruitment and data collection to build a predictive model capable of screening for common depressive signal we acknowledge that depression diagnosis exist across a clinical spectrum it is possible that participant with a specific type of depression were responsible for the observed result future research might examine other specific depression class including manic depression and dysthymia to determine whether predictive screening model should be segmented per diagnosis type it is also possible that inference from our result are limited specifically to twitter user who have been diagnosed with depression or ptsd and who are willing to share their social medium history with researcher current literature on depression treatment suggests that people who seek out mental health service are usually wellinformed and psychologically minded experience typical symptom of depression and little stigma and have confidence in the effectiveness of treatment few concern about side effect adequate social support and high selfefficacy since it is possible only a subset of twitter user will fit this description we recommend making conservative inference about depression a well a ptsd based on our finding considering the frequent comorbidity of depression and ptsd together with the similarity in predictor importance observed across our analysis of these two condition the signal driving our predictive model may share considerable overlap while our result do not offer strict segregation between these two condition this give little cause for concern when considered from a mental health screening perspective if the desired outcome is to identify individual who may be in need of mental health service whether an individual is flagged for evaluation for depression with possible associated ptsd or viceversa becomes an academic distinction if anything the

data using computational method our finding strongly support the claim that computational method can effectively screen twitter data for indicator of depression and ptsd our method identified these mental health condition earlier and more accurately than the performance of trained health professional and wa more precise than previous computational approach our statespace model portrayed a timeline for depression which is impressively realistic given that it wa generated analyzing only the text of character message in addition hmm identified a rise in probability of ptsd within six month posttrauma compared to the average month delay between trauma event and diagnosis experienced by the individual in our sample word shift provided context for the specific difference in language that shifted happiness score between sample these advance make improvement on existing predictive screening technology a well a contribute novel method for the identification and tracking of mental illness the hmm depression timeline is an intriguing finding and should be treated with both optimism and caution hmm assigned each data point a probability of belonging to two latent statespaces while blind to our actual state of interest a affectedhealthy label were removed from hmm training data considering that the model could have used criterion completely unrelated to mental health to delineate between the two latent class it is noteworthy that the resulting state mean estimate for each variable in both ptsd and depression analysis closely resembled the mean estimate for affected and healthy participant data respectively this add support for the claim that affectedcondition and healthy twitter user data are objectively different in addition to providing justification for the use of hmm assignment a indicator of depressionptsd signal at a given point in time despite this evidence in favor of applying hmm to analyze mental health trajectory hmm is an unsupervised learning procedure and so conclusive hmmbased inference should be approached cautiously and with close attention on validation procedure the diverging trajectory observed in our hmm time series suggest that with careful attention to model validity statespace modeling may be used to identify and track the onset of certain mental illness over time using only twitter data the labmt happiness measure proved to be the most important predictor in our model and wa considerably stronger than anew or liwc happiness indicator this is in line with a series of previous finding which have found labmt measure to be a superior for tracking happiness in twitter data and suggests that future research in this field should incorporate this instrument for more accurate measurement that average tweet word count wa the second most important predictor is intriguing especially a increase in word count were positively associated with depression and ptsd if anything depression is often characterized by reduced communication although word count is distinct from posting frequency which wa not a significant predictor in our model the current depression and ptsd literature are largely devoid of study relating verbosity to these condition and so this finding may motivate new inquiry into behavioral trait of mental health disorder a observed on social medium from a practical standpoint our model showed considerable improvement over the ability of unassisted general practitioner to correctly diagnose depression and ptsd despite the imprecise nature of this comparison given the paucity of data currently available to serve a benchmark for the type of analysis performed in the present study our model relative success seems encouraging health care provider may be able to improve quality of care and better identify individual in need of treatment based on the simple lowcost method outlined in this report especially given that mental health service are unavailable or underfunded in many country this computational approach which only requires patient digital consent to share their social medium history may open avenue to care which are currently difficult or impossible to provide future investigation would use the same participant pool to collect both health professional assessment a well a computational model of participant social medium behavior to allow for more precise comparison the present finding may be limited by the nonspecific use of the term depression in participant survey while earlier research identified depression predictor in twitter data for major depressive disorder and postpartum depression we used a more general category in our recruitment and data collection to build a predictive model capable of screening for common depressive signal we acknowledge that depression diagnosis exist across a clinical spectrum it is possible that participant with a specific type of depression were responsible for the observed result future research might examine other specific depression class including manic depression and dysthymia to determine whether predictive screening model should be segmented per diagnosis type it is also possible that inference from our result are limited specifically to twitter user who have been diagnosed with depression or ptsd and who are willing to share their social medium history with researcher current literature on depression treatment suggests that people who seek out mental health service are usually wellinformed and psychologically minded experience typical symptom of depression and little stigma and have confidence in the effectiveness of treatment few concern about side effect adequate social support and high selfefficacy since it is possible only a subset of twitter user will fit this description we recommend making conservative inference about depression a well a ptsd based on our finding considering the frequent comorbidity of depression and ptsd together with the similarity in predictor importance observed across our analysis of these two condition the signal driving our predictive model may share considerable overlap while our result do not offer strict segregation between these two condition this give little cause for concern when considered from a mental health screening perspective if the desired outcome is to identify individual who may be in need of mental health service whether an individual is flagged for evaluation for depression with possible associated ptsd or viceversa becomes an academic distinction if anything the issue of comorbidity may serve

model utilizing a million influenzarelated tweet and this wa compared to the cdc reported data the model could predict disease activity in realtime producing accurate data week before the cdc report using the internet a a form of sensor for monitoring mentalrelated condition ha also recently emerged a an important research topic such a monitoring suicidal behavior in australia or studying the influence of season to depression similarly mining the blog of military personnel involved in operation enduring freedom in iraq wa able to discern the emotional tone of blog and detect service personnel experience and emotional reaction to combat exposure language style based on the social and psychological meaning of word such a in liwc package have been explored across diverse research area in sociology and psychology for example liwc feature were found to be powerful predictor of influence and personality trait similarly language use ha been found a predictor of depression for example in a research of detecting linguistic cue of depression in english and spanish forum the linguistic marker of depression found in conventional written text were also found in the language of depression online for a corpus of essay written by depressed colleague student it wa found that depressed student used more first person singular pronoun and more negative emotion word in their essay than those student who did not experience any depressive episode in a study on suicide suicidal poet were found to use more first person pronoun and le first plural pronoun in their writing than did nonsuicidal poet further evidence of the value of word usage and expressive writing to physical and mental health is established in investigation into depression in online setting have been conducted for example online search activity ha been used to detect several depression phenomenon for example yang et al found the seasonality of online searching for depression term ayers et al found the seasonal trend in google searching for mental health term such a adhd anxiety bipolar depression anorexia schizophrenia and suicide this finding provides health care research novel evidence of seasonal depression based on public searching trend tefft found that there is a positive relationship between the google trend data on depression and anxiety with the unemployment rate similarly strong association were found between the internet search query volume on psychological distress term including anxiety disorder what is depression sign of depression depression symptom and symptom of depression with mortgage delinquency and unemployment statistic noticeably sueki found that the suicide death rate wa not correlated with the searching volume of suicide but wa correlated with the increase in searching for suiciderelated term such a depression for social network in online setting choudhury et al attempted to predict depressed individual based on their tweet including the diurnal trend or insomnia index based on the number of post made hourly also for twitter data park et al found difference in the reason of joining the social network between those with and without

subscriber status update were found to reveal symptom of major depressive episode providing a source to identify potential patient possibly suggesting a foundation for early warning system similarly jeong et al showed that using social network such a facebook for major depressive disorder screening among college student is feasible and efficient in a related problem cash et al found that adolescent reveal their suicidal thought and possible intention on myspace providing opportunity to identify adolescent at risk online social network have also been utilized for depression treatment george et al demonstrated that facebook can be used to treat stress and depression for firstyear medical student it ha also been demonstrated that using internetbased intervention in post traumatic stress disorder treatment is feasible kessler et al examined if a cognitivebehavioral therapy cbt delivered online incorporated into usual care can improve the treatment of depression they found that

based classifier for detecting mental health expression in reddit post we split up our corpus of post shared on the mh and cl community into a training set on which fold cross validation is applied and a validation set with post for training and for validation following fold cross validation with different classification approach we found our logistic regression model to yield the highest accuracy with an average precision recall and f score of each refer to the column on validation set table for these metric table present the confusion matrix corresponding to classification on this validation set we also note the areaundercurve auc value for this classifier corresponding to the receiver operating characteristic roc curve to be high see figure auc is a widely used metric because it show the tradeoff between true and false positive rate figure show that with only about of fpr we can achieve tpr of over illustrating high performance we also evaluate this best performing logistic regression in term of it explanatory power in the validation set over an equivalent null model we find that the difference between the deviance of the null model and the deviance of our model approximately follows a distribution with degree of freedom equal to the number of additional predictor feature in the latter model n p summarily our model result in significant reduction of deviance in classifying mh and cl post which ngram feature given by the logistic regression model are the most predictive of a post being classified to be mh or cl to answer this question we present in table the predictor feature with positive coefficient weight ie they are correlated with mh post and another predictor feature with negative coefficient weight ie they are correlated with cl post we illustrate the context of use of a sample of these feature to understand their relationship to classification outcome vast majority of the coefficient associated with positive weight pertain to expression of a variety of different mental health challenge bpd bipolar ptsd suicide depressed mental health some of the other feature with positive coefficient include mention of stress and anxiety anxiety anxious nervous some of the known concomitant of mental health concern other feature appear to be call for help and support seeking on reddit help talk request some feature also appear in discussion of treatment coping strategy and outcome med therapy medication diagnosed psychiatrist recovery finally a set of feature with positive coefficient also include manifestation of negative emotion hopelessness and dejection pain and even extreme thought of harming and killing oneself kill tired suicidal die worse on the other hand the predictor feature with large negative coefficient span a diverse range of topic ranging from event and experience christmas pregnant lifestyle workout gym sport game community participation and usage practice lpt request want know curious to reddit specific topic reddit redditors edit in summary we observe that our transfer learning based classifier is able to robustly detect and characterize mh expression in reddit post with high accuracy using the above trained and validated mhcl post classifier we then examined it performance in identifying mental health henceforth mh expression in the post belonging to the university subreddits for the purpose we first employed two raters to annotate a random sample of university subreddit post balanced across the two class to be about mh expression or not we used this annotated sample a a test set on which we applied our trained classifier our qualitative annotation task proceeded a follows adopting an inductive semiopen coding approach first two raters one a clinical psychologist and another a social medium expert independently assigned binary annotation mh expression or not to a subsample of post to arrive at these rule they referred to prior work on qualitative and quantitative study of mental health disclosure on social medium and literature in psychology on marker of mental health expression following this initial rating exercise the raters got together to resolve difference and constructed a final rulebook per this rulebook a post had to satisfy one of more of these criterion to be annotated to be a mh expression explicit expression of first hand experience of psychological distress or mental health concern i get overwhelmingly depressed i get into a negative spiral i think i am on the verge and feel like it the end explicit expression of support help or advice seeking around difficult life challenge and experience are there any resource i can use to talk to someone about depression i have been going to therapy for day a week every week for my anxiety using this rulebook the raters then annotated the larger sample of remaining post the final agreement wa found to be high cohens we then applied our trained classifier to this annotated test set of post we found our classifier to demonstrate consistent performance a before in the task of distinguishing between university subreddit post that are related to mh expression and those that are not we achieved a mean accuracy of with auc of see the second column on test set in table we therefore proceeded with using this classifier in machine labeling all of the other university subreddits post our classifier identified post to be mh expression whereas the rest of the post were marked not about the topic this corresponded to unique user out of a total of mean std dev across the subreddits,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,first we evaluate our transfer learning based classifier for detecting mental health expression in reddit post we split up our corpus of post shared on the mh and cl community into a training set on which fold cross validation is applied and a validation set with post for training and for validation following fold cross validation with different classification approach we found our logistic regression model to yield the highest accuracy with an average precision recall and f score of each refer to the column on validation set table for these metric table present the confusion matrix corresponding to classification on this validation set we also note the areaundercurve auc value for this classifier corresponding to the receiver operating characteristic roc curve to be high see figure auc is a widely used metric because it show the tradeoff between true and false positive rate figure show that with only about of fpr we can achieve tpr of over illustrating high performance we also evaluate this best performing logistic regression in term of it explanatory power in the validation set over an equivalent null model we find that the difference between the deviance of the null model and the deviance of our model approximately follows a distribution with degree of freedom equal to the number of additional predictor feature in the latter model n p summarily our model result in significant reduction of deviance in classifying mh and cl post which ngram feature given by the logistic regression model are the most predictive of a post being classified to be mh or cl to answer this question we present in table the predictor feature with positive coefficient weight ie they are correlated with mh post and another predictor feature with negative coefficient weight ie they are correlated with cl post we illustrate the context of use of a sample of these feature to understand their relationship to classification outcome vast majority of the coefficient associated with positive weight pertain to expression of a variety of different mental health challenge bpd bipolar ptsd suicide depressed mental health some of the other feature with positive coefficient include mention of stress and anxiety anxiety anxious nervous some of the known concomitant of mental health concern other feature appear to be call for help and support seeking on reddit help talk request some feature also appear in discussion of treatment coping strategy and outcome med therapy medication diagnosed psychiatrist recovery finally a set of feature with positive coefficient also include manifestation of negative emotion hopelessness and dejection pain and even extreme thought of harming and killing oneself kill tired suicidal die worse on the other hand the predictor feature with large negative coefficient span a diverse range of topic ranging from event and experience christmas pregnant lifestyle workout gym sport game community

of suffering from bpd but a somewhat noticeable probability of suffering from bipolar disorder at first glance the statistic provided are interesting but not detailed enough to understand for example why sample b ha a higher probability of suffering from bd than bpd in order to better understand each user we offer additional exploratory tool to analyze user behavioral and linguistic style a presented earlier there are various dimension or feature which are important for the plf model to produce satisfactory prediction the raw value of these feature are obtained from the social and polarity measure produced by the plf model social feature refer to the engagement activity of user and polarity feature refer to the affective trait of user social feature include tweeting frequency tweet count following unique mention mentioning frequency and frequently mentioned polarity feature include negative combo positive combo and flip ratio in addition to the raw value provided a sample sentiment timeline and sentiment ratio meter are demonstrated the timeline contains a sequence of tweet for a given period of time and it demonstrates the sentiment trend of the user the sentiment meter show the distribution of each sentiment for a given user a show in figure the polarity timeline and sentiment meter for both sample a left and sample b right are provided in comparison sample a express more negative thought than sample b this is expected a sample a is a suffering patient conversely sample b share more positive thought than sample a this is expected a this specific user is a widely known and joyful figure based on the sentiment meter and sentiment timeline it is becoming a little clear a to why there might be a difference of behavioral style between the two user however there is more to explore in term of the linguistic style preferred by each user to demonstrate the language frequently used term by each user we rely on the top k feature provided by the tfidf model a shown in figure a b a wordcloud visual component is used to observe the preferred choice of word by each user in both user worldclouds we can observe the frequent use of affectrelated word such a love hope need and like moreover it is clear that sample a wordcloud is packed with more emotion or sentiment word for those reason sentiment analysis is vital for these type of study additionally the wordcloud is able to visually give insight into the overall sentiment expressed by each user for instance sample b worldcloud show more positive word and sample a show more negative word besides exploring aggregated result it is also important to study the trend of mental status of each patient with respect to time a shown in figure c d the periodic mental status of each user is provided the line chart wa generated using the prediction obtained when using several batch of tweet for a given user ie each point represents the probability of a mental disorder for a specific period of time

noticeable probability of suffering from bipolar disorder at first glance the statistic provided are interesting but not detailed enough to understand for example why sample b ha a higher probability of suffering from bd than bpd in order to better understand each user we offer additional exploratory tool to analyze user behavioral and linguistic style a presented earlier there are various dimension or feature which are important for the plf model to produce satisfactory prediction the raw value of these feature are obtained from the social and polarity measure produced by the plf model social feature refer to the engagement activity of user and polarity feature refer to the affective trait of user social feature include tweeting frequency tweet count following unique mention mentioning frequency and frequently mentioned polarity feature include negative combo positive combo and flip ratio in addition to the raw value provided a sample sentiment timeline and sentiment ratio meter are demonstrated the timeline contains a sequence of tweet for a given period of time and it demonstrates the sentiment trend of the user the sentiment meter show the distribution of each sentiment for a given user a show in figure the polarity timeline and sentiment meter for both sample a left and sample b right are provided in comparison sample a express more negative thought than sample b this is expected a sample a is a suffering patient conversely sample b share more positive thought than sample a this is expected a this specific user is a widely known and joyful figure based on the sentiment meter and sentiment timeline it is becoming a little clear a to why there might be a difference of behavioral style between the two user however there is more to explore in term of the linguistic style preferred by each user to demonstrate the language frequently used term by each user we rely on the top k feature provided by the tfidf model a shown in figure a b a wordcloud visual component is used to observe the preferred choice of word by each user in both user worldclouds we can observe the frequent use of affectrelated word such a love hope need and like moreover it is clear that sample a wordcloud is packed with more emotion or sentiment word for those reason sentiment analysis is vital for these type of study additionally the wordcloud is able to visually give insight into the overall sentiment expressed by each user for instance sample b worldcloud show more positive word and sample a show more negative word besides exploring aggregated result it is also important to study the trend of mental status of each patient with respect to time a shown in figure c d the periodic mental status of each user is provided the line chart wa generated using the prediction obtained when using several batch of tweet for a given user ie each point represents the probability of a mental disorder for a specific period of time this component give insight into a patient onset period which are essential for mental disorder study a observed by choudhoury et al for brevity there is an apparent onset period for sample a may and one that is beginning to happen for sample b

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68764-y,11,5,classification models,"Kim, Lee, Park, Han",4,0,0,0,2020,we developed six binary classification model each of which categorizes a user specific post into one of the following subreddits rdepression ranxiety rbipolar rbpd rschizophrenia and rautism our conjecture is that a user who suffers from a specific mental problem writes a post on the corresponding subreddit that deal with the problem a user can write post across multiple subreddits if heshe suffers from multiple mental health problem eg a user suffering from both depression and anxiety however if the model is trained with the post of user who have multiple symptom like a prior study the classification model may suffer from noisy data therefore we developed six independent binary classification model for each symptom to improve the performance by developing six independent model for each mental disorder each of which us data where user suffer from only one particular mental problem we were able to accurately identify a user potential mental state for example to develop a model for detecting depression we labeled the post written by user who upload post only in the rdepression a the depression class the opposite class is referred to a the nondepression class to address a classimbalance issue for the collected data we applied the synthetic minority oversampling technique smote algorithm we divided our dataset into training and testing set then xgboost and convolutional neural network cnn were employed morover we excluded the post of user who wrote post across multiple subreddits in learning phase to quantitatively represent each post we converted the word in the training set to numerical representation fig for the xgboost classifier we used the tfidf vectorizer in the sckitlearn package to convert word into ndimensional vector in the case of the cnn classifier we applied wordembedding procedure from the preprocessed text using the wordvec api of python package gensim the word vector were pretrained with the training dataset collected for the current study with continuous bagofwords representation cbow model while the size of window wa set to five note that by using the pretrained wordvec model for representing each post for each subreddit a language style used by user who write post in a subreddit can be trained for the specific subreddit an overview of the proposed cnnbased model is presented in fig the model architecture is organized by the sequence of layer that includes an embedding layer convolutional layer maxpooling layer dense layer and the output fig illustrates how a post is trained in the given model the first layer of the model is an embedding layer that represents the word embeddings of a preprocessed post with dimension and it weight is initialized by the pretrained wordvec second a convolutional layer with input of word vector ha filter and each filter size is five in addition we applied a dropout rate of to prevent overfitting issue the next layer is a maxpooling layer which take the maximum value within the cnn filter and it dimension is the output of the maxpooling layer is passed through two fully connected dense layer and the final output is the probability of the classification through the sigmoid activation function which range from to for training the neural network we used both the binary crossentropy loss function and adam optimizer with a learning rate of our model wa trained through epoch and the batch size wa set to,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,we developed six binary classification model each of which categorizes a user specific post into one of the following subreddits rdepression ranxiety rbipolar rbpd rschizophrenia and rautism our conjecture is that a user who suffers from a specific mental problem writes a post on the corresponding subreddit that deal with the problem a user can write post across multiple subreddits if heshe suffers from multiple mental health problem eg a user suffering from both depression and anxiety however if the model is trained with the post of user who have multiple symptom like a prior study the classification model may suffer from noisy data therefore we developed six independent binary classification model for each symptom to improve the performance by developing six independent model for each mental disorder each of which us data where user suffer from only one particular mental problem we were able to accurately identify a user potential mental state for example to develop a model for detecting depression we labeled the post written by user who upload post only in the rdepression a the depression class the opposite class is referred to a the nondepression class to address a classimbalance issue for the collected data we applied the synthetic minority oversampling technique smote algorithm we divided our dataset into training and testing set then xgboost and convolutional neural network cnn were employed morover we excluded the post of user who wrote post across multiple subreddits in learning phase to quantitatively represent each post we converted the word in the training set to numerical representation fig for the xgboost classifier we used the tfidf vectorizer in the sckitlearn package to convert word into ndimensional vector in the case of the cnn classifier we applied wordembedding procedure from the preprocessed text using the wordvec api of python package gensim the word vector were pretrained with the training dataset collected for the current study with continuous bagofwords representation cbow model while the size of window wa set to five note that by using the pretrained wordvec model for representing each post for each subreddit a language style used by user who write post in a subreddit can be trained for the specific subreddit an overview of the proposed cnnbased model is presented in fig the model architecture is organized by the sequence of layer that includes an embedding layer convolutional layer maxpooling layer dense layer and the output fig illustrates how a post is trained in the given model the first layer of the model is an embedding layer that represents the word embeddings of a preprocessed post with dimension and it weight is initialized by the pretrained wordvec second a convolutional layer with input of word vector ha filter and each filter size is five in addition we applied a dropout rate of to prevent overfitting issue the next layer is a maxpooling layer which take the maximum value within the cnn filter and it dimension is the output of the maxpooling layer is passed through two fully connected dense layer and the final output is the probability of the classification through the sigmoid activation function which range from to for training the neural network we used both the binary crossentropy loss function and adam optimizer with a learning rate of our model wa trained through epoch

customer review and sentiment around news event we discus an application of social medium text mining in the context of understanding public mental health this is an increasingly important application domain prevalence of mental health condition is increasing and so is the amount of data we have to understand these condition while text data ha been analyzed in great depth for marketing purpose there remains a large opportunity in using text data to understand public mental health several researcher have identified social medium data such a twitter post a a valuable source for mental health signal however there remain critical gap in our ability to understand mental health people may not be willing to share mental health content publicly especially on the largest social medium platform which are associated with a personal identity in this paper we perform a mental health analysis on stigmatized topic by taking advantage of a unique dataset from a social medium app for posting journal entire and sharing and tracking mood referred to a the journalling app we discover issue that are not widely discussed on other social medium such a sleep in addition the journalling app requires user to track their mood in each journal hence we are equipped with userlabeled sentiment which otherwise is difficult to estimate by comparing the journalling app dataset to other social medium reddit we identify unique discussion that the moodtracking community attracts furthermore the journalling dataset is split into two segment user may share their journal publicly or keep them private hence we are able to understand which mental health issue are shared more publicly than others the question we seek to answer include doe the journalling dataset cover a different set of topic than those discussed on other social medium such a reddit are some topic shared more publicly than others are some topic kept private how is sentiment related to topic which topic elicit sad or happy feeling to answer these question we use a text mining methodology to derive topic from journal furthermore we take advantage of already labelled mood to perform sentiment analysis to summarize we make the following contribution we apply text mining to a unique dataset of journal and associated mood that ha not been studied before we discover a set of mental health topic that are not frequent on other social medium we quantify which topic are more public than others to identify gap in available social medium data for analyzing public mental health we compare how userlabeled mood vary across topic to identify important aspect of mental health that require attention the remainder of this paper is organized a follows we discus context and related work in sect we describe our datasets in sect we explain our methodology in sect followed by our result in sect and we conclude in sect this paper is related to two body of work social medium text mining and study of public mental health in the context of text mining there are standard analysis technique that enable topic modelling and sentiment analysis of social medium post in the mental health domain these technique have had several success including detecting user expressing suicidal thought on social medium we also use standard topic modelling technique but we utilize them to perform novel topic comparison between datasets mental health study traditionally collect information via health care professional which is a costly process and only allows for analysis of a small subset of the public a significant opportunity for understanding mental health through social medium data ha been identified by harman et al they focused on specific mental health condition and despite low incident rate they found a wealth of data on social medium they concluded that individual and populationlevel mental health analysis can be made significantly cheaper and more efficient than current method traditional therapy and study of mental health condition heavily utilize linguistic signal in diederich et al text processing is used to detect mental health condition such a schizophrenia by analyzing conversation between patient and their psychiatrist using clustering algorithm and sentiment classifier the drawback of most study utilizing doctorpatient data is privacy concern and smaller datasets these study tend to be more adhoc due to the size of data another large opportunity for mental health data analysis is in electronic medical record for example natural language processing nlp wa used to improve classification accuracy of depression in mood state of patient based on medical record the creation of a social medium corpus for mental health data could significantly improve mental health research there are two main methodology for analyzing mental health signal in social medium using linguistic signal the first relies on handcrafted lexicon containing connotation and strength of word for example the linguistic inquiry word count liwc lexicon ha been used to help clinician understand mental state given a patient writing the disadvantage of this method is that lexicon like liwc cover a very small portion of possible language used in informal context such a social medium the second common method is to train a language classifier model this technique is limited when groundtruth label are not available existing work ha attempted to approximate label and a conservative labeling approach is to filter for user who selfidentify with a condition in particular previous work searched for statement such a i wa diagnosed with x however there are caveat that the author identify with this approach in particular only a small sample of people would publicly selfidentify with a mental health condition despite this through a language model they were able to compare language us across specific mental health condition alternative pipeline for acquiring label to model social medium text include crowdsourcing and developing custom apps crowdsourcing involves surveying user in a previous study survey were used to study mental health trend in undergraduate student in our study we also identify schoolrelated issue among other thing a a frequent topic discussed by journallers while success with survey have been made having user agree to honestly share their personal information is difficult and it can be costly to solicit other data such a social medium from surveyed user on the other hand apps that interact with social medium such a facebook can be used to collect personality information and grant access to public status update however signal that are important for mental health analysis are not typically shared on facebook while existing work ha focused on traditional social medium talking about difficult issue is not common on these platform on the other hand the dataset we are studying is specifically designed for mood tracking the journalling apps goal is to destigmatize the expression of mental health it is fully anonymous and hence includes topic that are typically considered taboo on personally identifiable social medium platform moreover the dataset is a combination of both public and private journal allowing for more private topic to be mentioned frequently furthermore instead of focusing on specific mental health condition we choose to take a broader look into the state public mental health we demonstrate that simple interpretable signal can be derived from our dataset furthermore we use sentiment labeled by user to avoid relying on custom lexicon in particular one of our most important finding is a large issue with sleep in a study that correlated sleep problem with mental health problem it wa found that patient are much more able to identify when they have an issue with their sleep and more willing to reveal it to their doctor than a potential mental health concern furthermore patient selfperception of sleep issue wa strongly associated with health issue which demonstrates that people are able to accurately identify when a real problem is present while widescale study of sleep data using social medium have not been performed there is an increasing prevalence of sleeptracking mobile apps and tool for analyzing the quality of an individual sleep while traditional social medium ha helped people connect with friend and family anonymous social medium service are becoming increasingly used by people for sharing personal story and looking for advice these community are growing a the general public becomes comfortable sharing more information online and benefit people who are unable or do not want to see a doctor in person to talk about mental health we believe that these type of datasets will become increasingly important to analyze for researcher a such we explore another anonymous social medium platform reddit and compare mental health topic discussed on reddit to those written about on the journalling

mobile app we omit the name of the app for privacy and we refer to it a the journalling app reddit is a social medium platform that wa originally used for sharing and rating content such a news documentary and music user post in and subscribe to selforganized community known a subreddits subscribing to a subreddit allows a user to view all post from that subreddit an advantage of analyzing reddit data is that the subreddits are labelled according to their topic utilizing curated list from volunteer reddit user we crawled all subreddits related to mental health a well a all subreddits linked by these community the second dataset consists of anonymized journal post from a mobile app designed to help people track their mood and share them anonymously if they desire for each journal post the app requires the user to label the journal post with at least one mood selected from a prepopulated list including happy sad etc we obtained all journal and the associated mood written

mental health journalling mobile app we omit the name of the app for privacy and we refer to it a the journalling app reddit is a social medium platform that wa originally used for sharing and rating content such a news documentary and music user post in and subscribe to selforganized community known a subreddits subscribing to a subreddit allows a user to view all post from that subreddit an advantage of analyzing reddit data is that the subreddits are labelled according to their topic utilizing curated list from volunteer reddit user we crawled all subreddits related to mental health a well a all subreddits linked by these community the second dataset consists of anonymized journal post from a mobile app designed to help people track their mood and share them anonymously if they desire for each journal post the app requires the user to label the journal post with at least one mood selected from a prepopulated list including happy sad etc we obtained all journal and the associated mood written between january and january this amount to over million journal written by approximately user figure plot the number of journal posted over time most of the journal were

noun that do not refer to topic such a number timing eg today yesterday general feeling eg feel like proper noun and noun that have ambiguous meaning eg overall true lastly we only retained noun that appeared more than ten time in the dataset this process resulted in a vocabulary of word for topic modelling each journal is represented a a dimensional term frequency vector with each component denoting the termfrequency inversedocumentfrequency tfidf of the corresponding term algorithm summarizes our topic modelling methodology given a tfidf term frequency vector for each journal we run nonnegative matrix factorization nmf implemented in python scikitlearn package the objective of nmf is to find two matrix whose product approximates the original matrix in our case one matrix is the weighted set of topic in each journal and the other is the weighted set of word that belong to each topic hence each journal is represented a a combination of topic which are themselves composed of a weighted combination of word we chose nmf because it nonnegativity constraint aid with interpretability in the context of analyzing word frequency negative presence of a word would not be interpretable this is because we only track word occurrence and not semantics or syntax unlike other matrix factorization method nmf reconstructs each document from a sum of positive part which enables u to easily manually label the discovered topic iterating from to topic we derived different topic matrix step and of algorithm each matrix consists of one topic per row each topic ha a positive weight for each word in the vocabulary stronger weight indicate higher relevance to the topic the final topic matrix we used ha topic and is shown in table we show the first six word in this table for simplicity where we sorted the word associated with each topic from highest relevance to lowest when judging the topic matrix we considered the top twenty most important word per topic using this information we manually labeled each row in the matrix with a corresponding topic furthermore we manually evaluated each matrix based on the distinctness between topic consistency within topic and interpretability during this process we compiled a custom list of removed word that we mentioned earlier in this section the group of word we removed appeared a standalone topic that did not offer information about what the journal wa about for example proper noun appeared a a standalone topic other word which we deemed too general or ambiguous appeared across several topic and hence did not provide discriminative information we note that by default nmf doe not enforce word to be assigned a nonzero weight to only a single topic using our pruning procedure we ensured word that appeared across too many topic were removed we did permit word with multiple meaning for example high and word that apply in different setting for example yoga class versus academic class we note that the most important word based on weight for each topic generally did not overlap with ate being the exception our validation procedure outlined in sect ensured that the two topic dinner and meal were indeed distinct despite both assigning high weight to ate we tested different level of regularization to enforce sparseness in our model see for a discussion but did not find significant difference however one important modification we made to regularize each topic wa to make their first word only a strong a their second one by default first word are stronger than second word which are stronger than third word and so on this is since the most relevant word for each topic tended to be too strong of a signal regardless of how we changed the number of topic preprocessing procedure or regularization

cooccur time with each of the health condition in twitter post and search query we cluster the unigrams based on liwcs linguistic inquiry and word count wwwliwcnet category style category eg pronoun use are excluded to obtain a general sense of the context of use of each term for comparison across twitter and search we use a relative measure of use of each linguistic category to account for different usage in the two sourcesdefined in the same way a the relative use of a condition across condition severity we first compute the jensenshannon divergence between the unigram category distribution of the condition severitiestypes table next we show difference between unigram distribution on twitter and search table from table we observe that for both twitter and the search engine there are significant difference in the context of use of different condition for example the top unigram category for benign condition on twitter and the search engine are past and future tense word social work anxiety negative emotion and anger example unigrams include hate relieve tomorrow now cry worry school this suggests that people are referring to their benign condition with negativity in term of how they are disrupting their current and future social or professional life on the other hand mention of serious condition on twitter and the search engine tend to include category like see hear perception term body family death and number eg awareness treatment sign survival prognosis rate pain people may be seeking information related to the physical ordeal associated with serious health concern or specific treatment information next the context of use of symptom twitter and the search engine span the category health insight cognitive mechanism eg pain hard remedy medicine outbreak bad sleep woke feel ugh damn these indicate people may be seeking information to do a selfdiagnosis on their symptom a well a expressing frustration on the inconvenience the symptom may be causing finally examining the context of use of disability term we find that on twitter category like present and future money religion social and friend are common eg god day child support month special today please money this indicates that through their posting people share disability related information in the context of monetary cost and challenge and perhaps even seek comfort through sharing religious thought and reaching out to their social audience for search these span over motion health space work eg disorder school banned therapy treatment walk speak child disability can be a personal and social challenge and impact people life activity and work hence through search people appear to seek coping mechanism to deal with their condition and experience thus the context of use of disability is distinct from that of acute condition in fact comparing the unigram category usage around disability for twitter and search we find a distinctive contrast ref table perhaps individual are le inhibited in their search on disability since search engine provide a more private experience while seeking for information on a stigmatic experience mean stigma rating of the six disability across stigma level next we analyze the context of use of the health condition in the light of their level of social stigma we find that the context of use of high stigma condition is considerably different from that of low stigma condition this is consistent for both twitter and the search engine table for instance for low stigma term twitter and search engine use span context that includes category such a past present and future tense insight time and work eg life sleep week ugh now tomorrow people test effect work sign sick it appears that individual are seeking or sharing information on these condition in the light of their mundane day to day experience and how they are affecting their life and work condition however for high stigma condition usage context on twitter and search engine comprises category such a anger sadness anxiety health body and perception word like feel eg surgery hiv treatment hospital child prognosis die lost mad cure hate fight highly stigmatic condition appear to present themselves within context associated with mental stress and anxiety in twitter post and search query people also attempt to seek information on these highstigma condition for educational and treatment purpose however a one would expect table indicates that the context of use of high stigma condition on twitter and the search engine is statistically significantly different for twitter the unigram category for high stigma condition span sadness anxiety social perception word like see feel eg hope feel shit support please family suck mad fight in contrast for search they include health body feel motion eg sign treatment hospital child prognosis die surgery rate awareness this aligns with our prior observation individual are more cautious in the way they discus highly stigmatic condition on a public platform like twitter perhaps for fear of being judged by their audience and contact,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,from our log data we

count wwwliwcnet category style category eg pronoun use are excluded to obtain a general sense of the context of use of each term for comparison across twitter and search we use a relative measure of use of each linguistic category to account for different usage in the two sourcesdefined in the same way a the relative use of a condition across condition severity we first compute the jensenshannon divergence between the unigram category distribution of the condition severitiestypes table next we show difference between unigram distribution on twitter and search table from table we observe that for both twitter and the search engine there are significant difference in the context of use of different condition for example the top unigram category for benign condition on twitter and the search engine are past and future tense word social work anxiety negative emotion and anger example unigrams include hate relieve tomorrow now cry worry school this suggests that people are referring to their benign condition with negativity in term of how they are disrupting their current and future social or professional life on the other hand mention of serious condition on twitter and the search engine tend to include category like see hear perception term body family death and number eg awareness treatment sign survival prognosis rate pain people may be seeking information related to the physical ordeal associated with serious health concern or specific treatment information next the context of use of symptom twitter and the search engine span the category health insight cognitive mechanism eg pain hard remedy medicine outbreak bad sleep woke feel ugh damn these indicate people may be seeking information to do a selfdiagnosis on their symptom a well a expressing frustration on the inconvenience the symptom may be causing finally examining the context of use of disability term we find that on twitter category like present and future money religion social and friend are common eg god day child support month special today please money this indicates that through their posting people share disability related information in the context of monetary cost and challenge and perhaps even seek comfort through sharing religious thought and reaching out to their social audience for search these span over motion health space work eg disorder school banned therapy treatment walk speak child disability can be a personal and social challenge and impact people life activity and work hence through search people appear to seek coping mechanism to deal with their condition and experience thus the context of use of disability is distinct from that of acute condition in fact comparing the unigram category usage around disability for twitter and search we find a distinctive contrast ref table perhaps individual are le inhibited in their search on disability since search engine provide a more private experience while seeking for information on a stigmatic experience mean stigma rating of the six disability across stigma level next we analyze the context of use of the health condition in the light of their level of social stigma we find that the context of use of high stigma condition is considerably different from that of low stigma condition this is consistent for both twitter and the search engine table for instance for low stigma term twitter and search engine use span context that includes category such a past present and future tense insight time and work eg life sleep week ugh now tomorrow people test effect work sign sick it appears that individual are seeking or sharing information on these condition in the light of their mundane day to day experience and how they are affecting their life and work condition however for high stigma condition usage context on twitter and search engine comprises category such a anger sadness anxiety health body and perception word like feel eg surgery hiv treatment hospital child prognosis die lost mad cure hate fight highly stigmatic condition appear to present themselves within context associated with mental stress and anxiety in twitter post and search query people also attempt to seek information on these highstigma condition for educational and treatment purpose however a one would expect table indicates that the context of use of high stigma condition on twitter and the search engine is statistically significantly different for twitter the unigram category for high stigma condition span sadness anxiety social perception word like see feel eg hope feel shit support please family suck mad fight in contrast for search they include health body feel motion eg sign treatment hospital child prognosis die surgery rate awareness this aligns with our prior observation individual are more cautious in the way they discus highly stigmatic condition on a public platform like twitter perhaps for fear of being judged by their audience and

every reddit post receives a certain number of upvotes positive feedback and downvotes negative feedback we define the measure of karma to be the difference between the number of upvotes and downvotes

to observe the degree of emotional expressivity while for the question word it is to understand to what extent post on mental health seek explicit feedback or suggestion from the reddit community statistical technique we use negative binomial regression a our prediction method because both our dependent variable karma and comment are count and negative binomial regression is typically

others beyond linguistic description although displaying these emotion can make them susceptible to both judgment and encouragement further through the analysis of visual theme we found that image with a variety of distinct visual cue serve a a vehicle of expression of distress helplessness and social isolation to certain individual from the theme physical perception we can learn that shared visual imagery on instagram may be allowing some individual to seek feedback on atypical perception of their own physical image further we observed the use of imagery in sharing graphic content theme graphic image research identifies many underlying reason behind such physically damaging graphic expression such a normalization of behavior a a way to deal with emotional distress at the same time we observed mental health image on instagram also being mobilized to seek and provide psychosocial support and a safety valve this is observable in the theme captioned image that includes explicit call for help goffman posited the desire of individual with socially stigmatized experience to look for sympathetic others adopting the visual modality individual may be intending to bond around mental health topic one of our le expected finding is that the visual and the linguistic theme were considerably distinct these difference can be ascribed to the way that the theme capture not just different form of mental health disclosure on instagram they also capture the disinhibiting nature of people discourse with their audience a well a in expressing aspect of their experience that may not be easily communicated via either of the modality for instance the presence of the visual theme graphic image and physical perception indicates that individual are taking to the photosharing affordance of instagram a a way for emotional release around a distressful experience a keltner noted such tendency of emotional expression via the visual modality are a known attribute of many mental health sufferer at the same time linguistic theme provide u with contextual grouping around the shared visual imagery we found the presence of a linguistic theme around mental health awareness and recovery and others around specific positive and negative emotion together the two modality provide u a comprehensive picture of the characteristic of social medium based mental health disclosure

are largely based on the psycholinguistic lexicon liwc and were motivated from prior literature that examine association between the behavioral expression of individual and their response to traumatic context and crisis including vulnerability due to mental illness note that liwc ha been extensively validated to perform well on internet language we consider two measure of affect derived from liwc positive affect pa and negative affect na and four other measure of emotional expression anger anxiety sadness and swear we use liwc to define the cognitive measure a well a cognition comprising cognitive mech discrepancy inhibition negation death causation certainty and tentativeness and b perception comprising set of word in liwc around see hear feel percept insight and relative next we consider four measure of linguistic style a lexical density consisting of word that are verb auxiliary verb noun adjective identified using nltks po tagger and adverb b temporal reference consisting of past present and future tense c socialpersonal concern word belonging to family friend social work health human religion bio body money achievement home and sexual d interpersonal awareness and focus word that are st person singular st person plural nd person and rd person pronoun for social attribute we utilized a variety of content sharing social interaction and social support indicator these are post length number of comment vote difference difference between upvotes and downvotes divided by total upvotes and downvotes comment arrival rate average time difference between any two

examine precedingsucceeding celebrity suicide these are affective attribute cognitive attribute linguistic style attribute and social attribute measure belonging to all of these attribute category are largely based on the psycholinguistic lexicon liwc and were motivated from prior literature that examine association between the behavioral expression of individual and their response to traumatic context and crisis including vulnerability due to mental illness note that liwc ha been extensively validated to perform well on internet language we consider two measure of affect derived from liwc positive affect pa and negative affect na and four other measure of emotional expression anger anxiety sadness and swear we use liwc to define the cognitive measure a well a cognition comprising cognitive mech discrepancy inhibition negation death causation certainty and tentativeness and b perception comprising set of word in liwc around see hear feel percept insight and relative next we consider four measure of linguistic style a lexical density consisting of word that are verb auxiliary verb noun adjective identified using nltks po tagger and adverb b temporal reference consisting of past present and future tense c socialpersonal concern word belonging to family friend social work health human religion bio body money achievement home and sexual d interpersonal awareness and

https://aclanthology.org/W17-3110.pdf,20,5,symptom dynamics,"Loveys, Crutchley, Wyatt, Coppersmith",4,0,0,1,2017,broadly the motivation for exploring micropatterns and data on the timescale of minute and hour stem from the importance of temporal information in the assessment of psychological symptom knowledge of symptom cooccurrence over specified time period can determine whether a mental illness diagnosis is received a well a inform assessment of treatment responsiveness and relapse american psychiatric association nelson et al temporal information is essential to detecting ongoing fluctuation in psychological symptom which may be key to predicting the onset of psychological disorder or increased suicide risk mcgorry and van o emotion behavior and cognition fluctuate rapidly a an individual interacts with the environment van ockenburg et al van o people have tendency to behave think or feel certain way however condition and interaction fluctuate and one might have a markedly different reaction to the same environment on a different day these brief shift in behavior emotion cognition and physical symptom relative to one another in an environment over the course of second to hour can determine a person presentmoment psychological state van o the fluid vulnerability theory encapsulates this idea suggesting that daily perturbation in situational factor interact with dispositional factor to trigger presentmoment psychological state rudd dispositional or distal factor establish baseline risk and are relatively fixed variable such a demographic trait characteristic belief or life history which tend to indicate stable predisposition toward experiencing particular psychological state or disorder conversely situational or proximal factor indicate the likelihood that a person experience a mental illness episode or engages in selfharming behavior at a specific point in time example could include event such a the onset of a troubling thought or an unpleasant social interaction in the workplace the fluid vulnerability theory suggests that for individual with low baseline risk even a severe stressor will not elicit suicidality or exacerbation in mental illness symptom alternatively for people with high baseline risk situational factor conducive to suicidality or mental illness episode need not be a high for an episode to be triggered rudd

or engages in selfharming behavior at a specific point in time example could include event such a the onset of a troubling thought or an unpleasant social interaction in the workplace the fluid vulnerability theory suggests that for individual with low baseline risk even a severe stressor will not elicit suicidality or exacerbation in mental illness symptom alternatively for people with high

prevalence rate of mental illness ranged from clinician recognition of mental illness varied from and the association of key variable such a gender physical illhealth and education with mental illness were in opposite direction in different center these finding demonstrate the need for comparative crosscultural and crossnational study that can identify disclosure practice of mental illness the local need and thereby inform local policy and intervention we envision that leveraging social medium data to understand gender and culture based difference in mental health disclosure can contribute toward closing these data gap more data driven capability of mental health inferencing and monitoring can also increase the visibility of these issue and provide an impetus for vulnerable subgroup to seek help and for clinician to offer more treatment or intervention

lowera known sign of lowered selfesteem on the other hand female mid user express greater concern about health z cohens d higher and body z cohens d higher compared to their male peer this might indicate their greater selfawareness of their wellness status or perception of their physical health over the past year i have been hit with physical and mental pain the pain is real it is still there female my stomach sink everytime female an interesting finding here is the observation that male mid user exhibit lower use of social z cohens d friend z cohens d family z cohens d and bio word z cohens d this may imply that these user are le socially concerned or bothered by the same token the female peer might be using such language more extensively in their twitter post in order to explicitly seek help from their social network or to feel supported hard to really feel sick with this support group family female i miss having someone a friend to talk to all night female finally male mid user show a greater interest in religious discussion compared to female z cohens d higher god is working thing out for you even when you dont feel it have faith and be thankful while analyzing the social and personal concern expressed by the female and male user in the ctl cohort based on figure we do not observe such extensive difference the mean difference between the cohort per these measure is only interpersonal focus gender increased use of first person singular pronoun z cohens d higher in the post of male mid user show their selffocused behavior and disclosure of personal story i decided yesterday evening to go back to this thinking place there wa no one else there just me i had let my parent know where i wa male additionally lower use of second person pronoun z cohens d lower a well a that of third person pronoun z cohens d lower in the content of the male user tell u that they tend to be le interactive and engage in lesser discourse about others for the female and male user in the ctl cohort figure the interpersonal focus measure account for only of the

some thing are better left unsaid lonely night make for long night being drunk sometimes make it easier the second topic more prevalent among male mid user is topic and it show detachment from the

i love my relationship but it fun to wonder who wa just too shy or too afraid to ask me out i have suspicion but im self centered contrastively we examine the top two topic that manifest more extensively in post from female mid user compared to the male post associated with topic indicate the with mental health challenge and a desire for disclosure and help seeking eg fear rejection bury

cant keep whats not yours and you cant hold on to something that doesnt want to stay finally through topic the topic with the second highest likelihood of prevalence in female mid user post over male the female mid user share personal experience around mental illness including selfassessments and selfrealization eg pain control realization reminder i used to hurt myself because it wa the only pain

characterizing the usage of different linguistic measure across the four culture western country u gb and majority world country in and za in table we report the mean value of each statistically significant linguistic measure in each of the four culture a well a the result of kruskalwallis significance test comparing them for the purpose of the ensuing discussion we performed post hoc multiple comparison wilcoxon test to report which specific pair of culture differed most in term of the different linguistic measure further we discus our result by comparing the majority world culture in and za with the western culture u and gb the linguistic difference between these two cohort in the ctl group are shown in figure affective attribute culture first mid user from in and za express relatively higher pa h etasquared effect size e r and lower na h etasquared effect size e r anger h etasquared effect size e r anxiety h etasquared effect size e r and sadness h etasquared effect size e r compared to those from u and gb in other word user from the latter two culture u and gb tend to express emotional content that is more emotionally outspoken in comparison with the

larger than the affective difference observed for the culture in the ctl cohort see figure i hate myself with a burning passion right now i should be out on the sled u gb ive been cry all afternoon i feel like a bag of shit u gb being unhappy is the only thing i do right u gb cognitive attribute culture we also observe greater manifestation of cognitive impairment and emotional instability among

word h etasquared effect size e r additionally they also show reduced awareness of their social and environmental context a measured via the usage of article h etasquared effect size e r we note this

size e r and sexual h etasquared effect size e r in their twitter post compared to their peer from u and gb this might indicate a latent social norm in the former cohort to avoid sensitive discourse on a publicly accessible platform like twitter overall the difference in these two set of mid culture group is much higher compared to the difference observable in the ctl cohort interpersonal focus culture finally we observe the mid user from the western culture u and gb to demonstrate a greater tendency of social interaction use of second person pronoun word h a well a attention to people around them use of third person pronoun h etasquared effect size e r however the user from in and za express greater self preoccupation and selfattentional focus a measured in their use of more first

culture based on the lda topic model we first report on the statistical difference between the likelihood of prevalence of topic in the four culture group in figure b we show a distribution of the number of topic over their respective hstatistic value based on kruskal wallis test of comparing the topic of the four culture the figure indicates that a large number of topic have large hstatistic value eg over p df in turn revealing topical difference between the culture group next investigating these topical difference further we present the difference per the three different metric mean percentage difference in topic likelihood spearmans rank correlation and pointwise mutual information pmi the result are given in table across all pairwise difference for the three metric we observe that u and gb mid user aggregatively differ le topically compared to usin usza gbin or gbza for instance the spearmans rank correlation of topic used by u and in mid user is only however it is much higher for usgb this show that usgb topic are more similar to each other in their usage compared to the topic prevalent in u and in post another example is the measure of pointwise mutual information pmi for u and za it is only indicating their there are considerable difference in the likelihood of various topic across these two culture examining these number computed on the ctl user we observe le significant difference in topic likelihood together these indicate topical difference in the post of mid user from the four culture to be higher than that observed in their ctl cohort peer we now discus the context of usage of the top two topic that have a greater likelihood of occurrence in western culture u and gb post versus that in the majority world culture in and sa post shared by the mid user topic center around word like kill stop hate pain life all of which generally revolve around selfdeprecating selfcritical thought and selfdestruction my god life make me want to kill myself everything good is taken from me everything id rather my heart stop beating and my lung fail me that continue living through this constant pain next topic includes word like alone lonely people indicative of loneliness and lack of social support u and gb mid user post associated with high likelihood of this topic tend to bear a tone of decreased selfesteem and greater selfloathing lonely even when im not alone no one will ever be able to understand my family is supposed to be loving and accepting and they are the one who trigger me the most on the other hand the two top topic that are more prevalent in mid user from majority world culture in and za compared to those from western culture u and gb revolve around significantly different content for instance topic manifest confession and regret of individual eg faith regret strong regret will i ever beat this i wa doing so good but what happened to me i put so much faith in you being the one i wa so excited it just depression paranoia and panic got the better of me through topic the mid user in in and za express bereavement and marginalization due to the stigma associated with mental illness eg word pretend ashamed embarrassed struggle we observe that these mid user may be trying to resolve their problem through post associated this topic believing that mental health can be maintained by avoiding bad thought and exercising will power in fact wang et al have suggested that talking to another individual or group eg a mental health worker about psychological problem may be viewed by nonamerican sufferer a bringing disgrace on the family beyond tired i want this to end i cant pretend anymore need to be strong im still so embarrassed but im hurt more by him not being there for me i dont want to struggle alone fear is the biggest reason i dont want to admit that im depressed need to get over this i can do it interaction between gender and culture our final empirical investigation considers the interaction between gender and culture a measured linguistically for the sake of simplicity we do not include topical analysis for this last investigation in table we present mean value of the different linguistic measure grouped by category for male and female mid user in each of the four culture since not all linguistic measure were significant based on kruskalwallis significance test we computed the mean based on those that were indeed significant we additionally report in the table the mean relative difference between male and female mid user grouped by the western u gb and majority world in za culture we derive two major observation from this investigation first for the linguistic measure category female and male show systematic difference across the four culture that align with our finding from the gender analysis for instance a we had observed before female for all of the culture tend to express more positive affect and le negative affect compared to male from the corresponding culture they also show lower cognitive processing express more socialpersonal concern on twitter and tend to be more interpersonally focused all of which we had observed before this indicates that gender difference are persistent over culture at least in the context of the four culture we study here our second observation revolves around assessing the extent of linguistic difference between female and male spanning the four culture even in the light of the above finding around systematic difference in the linguistic expression of the two gender group across culture not all culture show the same extent of difference interestingly the relative difference between female and male are greater for the two majority world culture in za in contrast to the west ern culture u gb for instance positive affect difference between female and male in the former culture group is whereas it is only in the case of the latter causal link eg whether culture indeed impact gendered expression of mental health on social medium cannot be easily derived however putting it together these observation indicate that with regard to social medium disclosure of mental health culture and

individual use online mental health platform we begin our analysis by creating a dataset of user from different national community on talklife a support platform with over half a million user for this analysis due to the fact that most research in cscw on mental health online ha been done either agnostic of cultural context or in a western context we choose to focus on user from nonwestern country following zhang et al a researcher located in the global south and with lived experience interacting with the health system and diverse explanatory model of mental illness we believe that moving the focus of cscw and cscwadjacent mental health research away from the west is crucial to better meet the need of people often underserved by the medical system to create these subgroup of user we choose the three nonwestern country with the highest user population on talklife or india malaysia and the philippine guided by the rich amount of literature on the unique nuance to mental health expression for each country we examine the national identity linguistic and behaviorbased difference of use between each user subgroup in particular this research note that a a result of cultural norm around the sharing of distress and alternative conceptualization of mental illness in india malaysia and the philippine symptom are often expressed in somatic and religious term a opposed to traditionally clinical or psychiatric term we choose to analyze each subgroup at the national level for both theoretical and practical reason on a theoretical level in past work in the medical anthropology of mental health national identity ha commonly been used for a approximate level of analysis for cultural identity additionally on a more practical level each user country wa determined using their ip address by talklife and shared with u in an useranonymized dataset inferring a more precise location could potentially compromise user anonymity a discussed in past work and did not seem to have any more significant value for our analysis of cultural difference than analysis at the national level we analyze data from indian user malaysian user and filipino user a shown in table collectively we refer to these country a the minority sample a a comparison set we construct a random sample of all thread on talklife and refer to it a the majority sample due to the relative prevalence of user from western englishspeaking country in talklife most of the thread in the majority sample include post from country such a the usa uk and canada indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on talklife data wa sampled from may to june following this crossnational analysis to see if our broader result on talklife generalize to a differently structured online mental health community we picked the largest western country the united state and the largest nonwestern country india represented on cup a similar support platform with more than user actively using the platform each week using cup data we repeat our analysis testing for the same cultural difference we found in our talklife sample for this analysis we were provided a sample of data on activity from indian user and american user a shown in table unlike our sample of talklife user this dataset is not a random sample there is an upsampling of indian user to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of indian in the dataset like on talklife indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on cup we focus on indian user due to a lack of sufficient data on user from malaysia or the philippine data wa sampled from march august defining cultural identity and use of clinical language in this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forum to do so we leverage tomlinsons definition of cultural identity a self and communal definition based around specific usually politically inflected differentiation gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that run along national line a delineated by hall et al a a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other form of identity including religious or ethnic identity however in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity a a proxy for cultural identity additionally following schlesinger et al call for more intersectional analysis and method within hci we also include analysis of adjacent and intersecting identity when relevant including religious identity to analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnosis following method used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigram and trigram from a list of mental disorder a defined by the international classification of disease icd and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder dsm we also included all unigrams from the macmillan dictionary list of word used to describe illness and disease both specifically for mental illness and general illness a a result we include unigrams like night from night terror or sleep from sleep disorder a these are often correlated with specific symptom of mental illness or distress such a sleep issue or being awake at night this included any clinically common abbreviation for mental disorder such a ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder or bpd for borderline personality disorder shorthand for disorder commonly used by online community such a proana a used in proeating disorder community were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these term across disorder we choose to use term from and associated with dsm and icd categorized disorder a a result of the common usage of these framework globally throughout our analysis of these varied factor we use to represent mean and to represent standard deviation constraint limitation and tradeoff cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting level including subculture and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity a a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraint in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis one large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level a a proxy for cultural identity though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity a argued by both hall and tomlinson each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identity that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity a more rich analysis of these other form of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusion about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support community particularly with regard to cultural difference between user with the same national identity additionally to stay consistent between analysis a a result of a lack of data on user from malaysia and the philippine we only analyze user in india on cup and extend these finding to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum we draw validity for these exploratory finding from similar consistent pattern we observe between indian malaysian and filipino user but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority community these conclusion do not hold true additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used dsm and icd both framework of illness categorization have significant limitation particularly in the country we have selected for example there are both mental health disorder that are culturebound a well a mental health language that is used in different way within the specific country we analyze such a depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illness additionally it is clear that online support community often develop their own cultural norm and language around mental health and a deeper understanding of how this play out on talklife and cup is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work in this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical term for mental health disorder in our analysis of clinical language a detailed in past anthropological research it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across culture a a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder a opposed to conceptualizing distress a stress tension or depression for our analysis we strictly analyzed post that were in the latin alphabet with almost all post on both talklife and cup being in english however a both malay and tagalog are most commonly written in the latin script and since it is common for user from india speaker to use romanized version of indian language online it is possible that a small minority of post in our analysis were text in a different language however a confirmed by only seeing english word used in our analysis of the top ngrams among each user subgroup it is clear that english is the predominant language on both platform though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of nonenglish codeswitching on these platform could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interaction on expression between user with the same national identity but

sample of talklife user this dataset is not a random sample there is an upsampling of indian user to ensure that we have data from a sufficient number of indian in the dataset like on talklife indian are the largest nonwestern minority subgroup on cup we focus on indian user due to a lack of sufficient data on user from malaysia or the philippine data wa sampled from march august defining cultural identity and use of clinical language in this work we examine the relationship between cultural identity and use of online mental health support forum to do so we leverage tomlinsons definition of cultural identity a self and communal definition based around specific usually politically inflected differentiation gender sexuality class religion race and ethnicity nationality particularly looking at the aspect that of modern cultural identity that run along national line a delineated by hall et al a a diverse and amorphous form of identity cultural identity can often intersect and interact with other form of identity including religious or ethnic identity however in the absence of direct information about religious or ethnic identity based on the data available we use national identity a a proxy for cultural identity additionally following schlesinger et al call for more intersectional analysis and method within hci we also include analysis of adjacent and intersecting identity when relevant including religious identity to analyze clinical language we use a broader definition of clinical language than just specific medical diagnosis following method used in past work to analyze antidepressant related language we create a dataset of clinical mental health language including unigrams bigram and trigram from a list of mental disorder a defined by the international classification of disease icd and diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder dsm we also included all unigrams from the macmillan dictionary list of word used to describe illness and disease both specifically for mental illness and general illness a a result we include unigrams like night from night terror or sleep from sleep disorder a these are often correlated with specific symptom of mental illness or distress such a sleep issue or being awake at night this included any clinically common abbreviation for mental disorder such a ocd for obsessive compulsive disorder or bpd for borderline personality disorder shorthand for disorder commonly used by online community such a proana a used in proeating disorder community were not included due to the difficulty in finding an exhaustive list of these term across disorder we choose to use term from and associated with dsm and icd categorized disorder a a result of the common usage of these framework globally throughout our analysis of these varied factor we use to represent mean and to represent standard deviation constraint limitation and tradeoff cultural identity can exist at many different and intersecting level including subculture and subcommunities within the larger umbrella of a cultural identity a a result for the purpose of this analysis we had to adopt some constraint in order to do a meaningful and specific analysis one large limiting constraint that we chose for this study is to use national identity at the state level a a proxy for cultural identity though a major and formative part of modern cultural identity a argued by both hall and tomlinson each country we analyze is incredibly diverse with many individual cultural identity that both intersect and diverge from a greater national identity a more rich analysis of these other form of cultural identity is beyond the scope of this work but could lead to richer conclusion about the nature of cultural identity in online mental health support community particularly with regard to cultural difference between user with the same national identity additionally to stay consistent between analysis a a result of a lack of data on user from malaysia and the philippine we only analyze user in india on cup and extend these finding to the experience of being part of a minority group on an online mental health forum we draw validity for these exploratory finding from similar consistent pattern we observe between indian malaysian and filipino user but a deeper analysis with a larger dataset is likely necessary to determine when and for which minority community these conclusion do not hold true additionally while we construct clinical language through use of the commonly used dsm and icd both framework of illness categorization have significant limitation particularly in the country we have selected for example there are both mental health disorder that are culturebound a well a mental health language that is used in different way within the specific country we analyze such a depression often being an umbrella term for all mental illness additionally it is clear that online support community often develop their own cultural norm and language around mental health and a deeper understanding of how this play out on talklife and cup is neither the focus nor within the scope of this work in this work we intentionally use standard clinical and medical term for mental health disorder in our analysis of clinical language a detailed in past anthropological research it is theorized that the use of medical and clinical language is representative of a medicalized explanatory model of illness and we frame use of this language across culture a a approximate signifier of a greater awareness of the presence of a mental disorder a opposed to conceptualizing distress a stress tension or depression for our analysis we strictly analyzed post that were in the latin alphabet with almost all post on both talklife and cup being in english however a both malay and tagalog are most commonly written in the latin script and since it is common for user from india speaker to use romanized version of indian language online it is possible that a small minority of post in our analysis were text in a different language however a confirmed by only seeing english word used in our analysis of the top ngrams among each user subgroup it is clear that english is the predominant language on both platform though beyond the immediate scope of this work a greater analysis of nonenglish codeswitching on these platform could lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of interaction on expression between user with the same national identity but different language

understand the contentbased difference between post from individual in the minority sample we compare the top unigrams bigram and trigram from each minority country to those from the majority sample we filter out any word that were only one character a well a the natural language toolkits built in stopwords the top ngrams unigrams bigram and trigram can be seen in table ngrams that have been redacted are the usernames of talklife user that were discussed in plain text by others on the website we can make a few observation from the relative frequency of ngrams first english is the most commonly used language within each community on talklife a word from language native to each country were not the majority of any of the ngrams second top ngrams from the majority sample are not common to the top ngrams in any of the minority sample suggesting a difference in how people express mental health even when people are talking about the same theme such a getting support they tend to use different phrase the majority sample us need someone to talk to while indian prefer like to talk to friend third while much of the language most often expressed by user in the majority sample is support language expressing individual distress such a im or feel we find that people from the minority sample are more likely to talk about themselves in relation to other people a illustrated by the bolded ngrams in table for example individual from the minority sample use the term u at a higher amount than those in the majority sample further individual from india often talk about wanting or needing friend whereas individual from malaysia and filipino refer to loneliness using the word alone more often than people in the majority sample this use of term related to interpersonal connection to express mental distress is seen in india malaysia and the philippine when individual experiencing distress are asked to describe how they are feeling our finding extends this work in the context of online mental health support community finally reference to religion such a god or pray find peace are more common in post from malaysia and the philippine this follows past research on the expression of mental health in both malaysia and the philippine showing that religion is often used a a foundation for how people from these cultural background express mental health concern and for how people support one another the higher presence of reference to religion among user from malaysia and the philippine might also suggest that index post that discus religion but do not specifically discus distress might actually be one culturallysanctioned method of signposting a state of mental distress a seen in past research in offline context difference in clinical language use based on past research showing that individual from minority country often express mental distress in nonclinical term we examine the use of clinical language on online mental health support community for this analysis of clinical language around mental distress from different country we use data from the top of user based on number of post on talklife to analyze a greater number of post a table show the amount of clinical language consistently differs between the majority sample and minority sample we find that clinical language is used le frequently in post from the minority sample than in the majority sample for indian malaysian and filipino of index post have clinical language respectively compared to for the majority sample we see a similar but smaller difference for support response of support response tend to have clinical language for the minority sample compared to for the majority samplethese difference are significant with a p unless otherwise indicated for all country though we find consistently that support response have le amount of clinical language than index post however if we look at the frequency of clinical language within post the difference between the minority sample and the majority sample is small combined with the evidence that the fraction of post with at least one use of clinical language is substantially lower for the minority sample this implies that there must be higher use of clinical language term per post for each post from the minority sample that doe contain clinical language this implication is verified by the last two row of table when we restrict our analysis to only those post that do contain clinical language post from the minority sample use more clinical mental health language in comparison to the majority sample for both index post and support response with a statistically significant difference at p thus while a smaller fraction of post in the minority sample use clinical language overall there is a big variation in it use post that do use clinical language tend to use many more term per post than those from majority country suggesting that people who do use clinical language from minority country are participating in a standard and globalized language around describing clinical mental health table confirms the above result when we look at the top unigrams bigram and trigram of clinical language used by people from different country the percentage for each term or ngram correspond to the fraction of occurrence of the ngram relative to all clinical ngrams we find that there is not much variation between the clinical language term that are used across the different country the disorder that are talked about most explicitly such a borderline personality disorder personality disorder or social anxiety are used at relatively consistent rate between both the minority sample and the majority sample a posited above it is possible that this consistency in type of clinical language hint at some form of standardization in how those user who use clinical language use it a globalized online clinical language around mental health and a potential difference between past work on expression of distress in offline setting that said it should be noted that some of the most popular ngrams especially unigrams such a sleep and night can function a false positive a not every mention of sleep or night on talklife is a reference to a mental health issue such a sleep paralysis or night terror these term may also be used in different and culturally bound way more specific term bigram such a anxiety disorder and trigram such a borderline personality disorder are used rarely finally we also report potential crosscultural difference when individual first begin to use clinical language on talklife on average indian tend to use clinical language on the th post mean whereas malaysian filipino and the population from the majority sample tend to use clinical language on the th post mean interpretation of these result will require more work investigation the reason why indian use clinical language later in a thread on balance these result show that individual from the minority sample

minority country are often le likely to use clinical language when conceptualizing and describing their experience of mental distress,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,general linguistic difference to better understand the contentbased difference between post from individual in the minority sample we compare the top unigrams bigram and trigram from each minority country to those from the majority sample we filter out any word that were only one character a well a the natural language toolkits built in stopwords the top ngrams unigrams bigram and trigram can be seen in table ngrams that have been redacted are the usernames of talklife user that were discussed in plain text by others on the website we can make a few observation from the relative frequency of ngrams first english is the most commonly used language within each community on talklife a word from language native to each country were not the majority of any of the ngrams second top ngrams from the majority sample are not common to the top ngrams in any of the minority sample suggesting a difference in how people express mental health even when people are talking about the same theme such a getting support they tend to use different phrase the majority sample us need someone to talk to while indian prefer like to talk to friend third while much of the language most often expressed by user in the majority sample is support language expressing individual distress such a im or feel we find that people from the minority sample are more likely to talk about themselves in relation to other people a illustrated by the bolded ngrams in table for example individual from the minority sample use the term u at a higher amount than those in the majority sample further individual from india often talk about wanting or needing friend whereas individual from malaysia and filipino refer to loneliness using the word alone more often than people in the majority sample this use of term related to interpersonal connection to express mental distress is seen in india malaysia and the philippine when individual experiencing distress are asked to describe how they are feeling our finding extends this work in the context of online mental health support community finally reference to religion such a god or pray find peace are more common in post from malaysia and the philippine this follows past research on the expression of mental health in both malaysia and the philippine showing that religion is often used a a foundation for how people from these cultural background express mental health concern and for how people support one another the higher presence of reference to religion among user from malaysia and the philippine might also suggest that index post that discus religion but do not specifically discus distress might actually be one culturallysanctioned method of signposting a state of mental distress a seen in past research in offline context difference in clinical language use based on past research showing that individual from minority country often express mental distress in nonclinical term we examine the use of clinical language on online mental health support community for this analysis of clinical language around mental distress from different country we use data from the top of user based on number of post on talklife to analyze a greater number of post a table show the amount of clinical language consistently differs between the majority sample and minority sample we find that clinical language is used le frequently in post from the minority sample than in the majority sample for indian malaysian and filipino of index post have clinical language respectively compared to for the majority sample we see a similar but smaller difference for support response of support response tend to have clinical language for the minority sample compared to for the majority samplethese difference are significant with a p unless otherwise indicated for all country though we find consistently that support response have le amount of clinical language than index post however if we look at the frequency of clinical language within post the difference between the minority sample and the majority sample is small combined with the evidence that the fraction of post with at least one use of clinical language is substantially lower for the minority sample this implies that there must be higher use of clinical language term per post for each post from the minority sample that doe contain clinical language this implication is verified by the last two row of table when we restrict our analysis to only those post that do contain clinical language post from the minority sample use more clinical mental health language in comparison to the majority sample for both index post and support response with a statistically significant difference at p thus while a smaller fraction of post in the minority sample use clinical language overall there is a big variation in it use post that do use clinical language tend to use many more term per post than those from majority country suggesting that people who do use clinical language from minority country are participating in a standard and globalized language around describing clinical mental health table confirms the above result when we look at the top unigrams bigram and trigram of clinical language used by people from different country the percentage for each term or ngram correspond to the fraction of occurrence of the ngram relative to all clinical ngrams we find that there is not much variation between the clinical language term that are used across the different country the disorder that are talked about most explicitly such a borderline personality disorder personality disorder or social anxiety are used at relatively consistent rate between both the minority sample and the majority sample a posited above it is possible that this consistency in type of clinical language hint at some form of standardization in how those user who use clinical language use it a globalized online clinical language around mental health and a potential difference between past work on expression of distress in offline setting that said it should be noted that some of the most popular ngrams especially unigrams such a sleep and night can function a false positive a not every mention of sleep or night on talklife is a reference to a mental health issue such a sleep paralysis or night terror these term may also be used in different and culturally bound way more specific term bigram such a anxiety disorder and trigram such a borderline personality disorder are used rarely finally we also report potential crosscultural difference when individual first begin to use clinical language on talklife on average indian tend to use clinical language on the th post mean whereas malaysian filipino and the population from the majority sample tend to use clinical language

respectively one way to interpret this result is that thread on le severe mental health issue are more likely to be have a moment of change and those on severe mental health issue are le likely so to verify we look into the specific ngrams that were found in both type of thread whether a lower overall clinical language also corresponds to le severe symptom or disorder first it is important to note that disorder with severe symptom more often have a formal diagnosis in india and it is also the case that undiagnosed mental distress that is le severe is often couched in language that is le clinical such a description that use word like stress or tension to confirm that the relation we find between lower clinical language and a greater rate of success on thread wa not due simply to le

based approach a an approximate measure to check for any substantial difference in severity of issue discussed a seen in table for unigrams for example we find no significant difference in the specific diagnosis being discussed this suggests that lower clinical language in thread with a moment of change is not simply due to difference in severity of mental health issue but rather a complex

there are specific cultural difference in how people from different minority community use and express their mental health in online mental health support community more specifically we find that individual from underrepresented country are more likely than the majority to mention their country of origin are more likely than the majority to use lower amount of clinical language and prefer to be supported and be supported by individual from the same national background we also find that these cultural difference have significant impact on whether individual are able to have interaction in which they have some positive improvement in their wellbeing particularly with regard to being supported by people from the same community and a lower level of clinical language being used we also

majority to use lower amount of clinical language and prefer to be supported and be supported by individual from the same national background we also find that these cultural difference have

conceptual overlap in many cluster especially those pertaining to depression suicide ideation psychological disorder and selfharm in addition to finding more general topic in some case the informal latent topic are more specific than the expertly derived risk factor a good example of this is the risk factor drug abuse and the related informal topic the first cluster represents the notion of pill

evaluated the latent topic represented by cluster of word we then compared these topic to risk factor generated by domain expert our indepth analysis revealed several key finding first we found that the topic discovered by our analysis had a large scope topic ranged from cry to clothing to the calendar this illustrates that our model wa able to identify different latent topic within the corpus and separate them into meaningful cluster it also show that there are topic that people discus which are not directly related to suicide a not every word is on the topic of suicide when comparing our automatically generated topic to previously identified risk factor we found that there were some difference in the focus of the topic compared to that of the risk factor in the case of drug abuse people tended to discus recreational drug specifically alcohol separately from medication and pill this difference in focus show how the public view of these two topic may fit under the umbrella term provided by expert but differ enough to be separate topic on the other hand in the case of family violence and discord and suicide around individual the topic generated by our model seemed to indicate a broader topic rather than topic a specific a these risk factor a result of collecting data from public user with presumably no professional medical experience is the difference in precision of language between user and medical professional an indicator of this difference is in discussing depression while professional made a difference between depressive feeling and depressive symptom the topic identified from user post overlapped these idea this may be partly due to the fact that depressive feeling are a symptom of depression but also to a lack in precise use of language to describe specific experience and symptom our contribution to this field is the discovery of latent topic within textual data known to contain suicidal ideation a common method for identifying suicidal ideation in social medium is to use a filter designed by medical professional to extract data such a technique may impose a structure on the data by medical professional that doe not reflect the actual language used by those experiencing suicidal ideation our method us topic modeling to uncover informal latent topic directly from social medium post which capture the idea deemed important by those who are sharing their experience with an online community this information will inform the medical community which informal topic are important to monitor in informal context such a social medium to effectively identify suicidal ideation,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,to evaluate our model we first subjectively evaluated the latent topic represented by cluster of word we then compared these topic to risk factor generated by domain expert our indepth analysis revealed several key finding first we found that the topic discovered by our analysis had a large scope topic ranged from cry to clothing to the calendar this illustrates that our model wa able to identify different latent topic within the corpus and separate them into meaningful cluster it also show that there are topic that people discus which are not directly related to suicide a not every word is on the topic of suicide when comparing our automatically generated topic to previously identified risk factor we found that there were some difference in the focus of the topic compared to that of the risk factor in the case of drug abuse people tended to discus recreational drug specifically alcohol separately from medication and pill this difference in focus show how the public view of these two topic may fit under the umbrella term provided by expert but differ enough to be separate topic on the other hand in the case of family violence and discord and suicide around individual the topic generated by our model seemed to indicate a broader topic rather than topic a specific a these risk factor a result of collecting data from public user with presumably no professional medical experience is the difference in precision of language between user and medical professional an indicator of this difference is in discussing depression while professional made a difference between depressive feeling and depressive symptom the topic identified from user post overlapped these idea this may be partly due to the fact that depressive feeling are a symptom of depression but also to a lack in precise use of language to describe specific experience and symptom our contribution to this field is the discovery of latent topic within textual data known to contain suicidal ideation a common method for identifying suicidal ideation in social medium is to use a filter designed by medical professional to extract data such a technique may impose a structure on the data by medical professional that doe not reflect the actual language used by those experiencing suicidal ideation our method us topic modeling to uncover informal latent topic directly from social medium post which capture the idea deemed important by those who are sharing their experience with an online community this information will inform the medical community which informal topic are important to monitor in informal context such a social medium to effectively identify suicidal

rmn parameter were set according to the value recommended in we use data from all subreddits combined a input since we want to obtain descriptor common to all community table iv present the term descriptor associated with each topic found by rmn it is interesting to note that the model capture several topic containing coherent descriptor ie topic whose main term are clearly related showing that the four subreddits we analyzed share a common language and that topic are closely related to mental health disorder see for example topic the result presented below focus on the analysis of the descriptor that are shown in bold in table iv table v list possible interpretation of highlighted topic each user in a subreddit ha a set of comment and post called span by rmn for each span in the input rmn output a probability vector over topic to analyze the topic that compose a subreddit we calculate the average of the vector associated to the respective span this average is a vector that can be interpreted a the probability distribution over topic for a span selected uniformly at random from the dataset for each subreddit figure show the average probability associated with each topic in table v note that topic among the we analyzed is the most prominent in the four community this topic contains positive descriptor indicating that user of the subreddits offer support and help to each other mainly through word of optimism and perspective of a better future topic which includes term of encouragement is very likely in all subreddits topic is the second most frequent in the depression and the suicide community this topic ha negative sentiment descriptor and refers to death injury guilt etc this is expected of community focused on discussing problem related to depression and suicide subreddits depression and suicide have very similar profile with respect to these topic however two topic distinguish them i topic it is more likely to appear in depression this topic comprises descriptor related to a sense of worthlessness and waste which indicates that people in the depression community express more often a sense of worthlessness topic which refers to place and group of relationship friend girlfriend university meeting occurs more frequently in the depression and the suicide community suggesting that the mental health problem of the user in these community have been triggered by some friction in their relationship with peer topic concern insecurity and adolescence issue being a more frequent subject in the suicide community and potentially reflecting problem of bullying commonly experienced in this stage of life we also use rmn to analyze post and comment made by user in order to define user profile a probability distribution over topic to do so we calculate the average of the vector associated with user span for each topic t in table v we discus the profile of the five most relevant user ie those whose probability mass associated with t are largest a previously described topic is characterized by descriptor inclined towards social support out of the five most relevant user for this topic four are part of subreddit suicide and the other is part of subreddit depression at the same time the probability mass of topic with more negative descriptor and is small for these user these user tend to behave a counselor offering help to other member of these community topic ha highly negative descriptor out of five most relevant user for this topic three are in subreddit suicide community and the other two in subreddit depression it is important to point out that while these user have a more negative discourse they have a relatively high probability mass associated with topic which reflects a discourse of optimism and possible improvement this finding corroborates the analysis in where the author conclude that people who go through period of great hardship are more likely to think about the future and to be positive when aided by others who offer help the span of user most relevant to topic linked to suggestion for activity to soften a negative emotional condition also have large probability mass associated with topic
